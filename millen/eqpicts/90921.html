         Those of us that are used to working with modern scopes don't often run into units
         such as the 90921. Millen manufactured, and still does, oscilloscopes in many different
         forms. Including those which were essentially just basic monitor scopes comprising
         power supply, cathode ray tubes and simple circuitry to adjust brilliancy and centering
         along with connections for the vertical and horizontal plates. This unit would provide
         the needed vertical and horizontal amplifiers and a saw-tooth generator to provide
         horizontal sweep. In many ways it is similar to the plug-ins used in more modern
         oscilloscopes.<Br>
