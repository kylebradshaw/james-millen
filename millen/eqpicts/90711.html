         This VFO uses a temperature compensated 6SK7 vacuum tube in an electron coupled
         oscillator configuration. Another 6SK7 is used for a buffer or doubler and finally
         a 6AG7 tuned amplifier is track-tuned to the oscillator. The power supply is regulated
         to improve overall stability of this VFO. In addition, since there is such good
         isolation between the oscillator and output the oscillator will not shift in frequency
         with an output loading variation from open to short circuit! This VFO was designed
         for operation on 160, 80, 40 and 20 meters.<Br>
