         A later redesign and updated version of the famous 90651 Grid-Dip meter. It incompasses
         two major changes over its predecessor a transistor DC amplifier and a taut band
         meter. Overall sensitivity was increased with the solid-state DC amplifier. A taut
         band meter eliminates meter sticking when a meter's pointer needle pegs in either
         direction. As with the 90651 this was considered to be a Standard Grade dipper with
         slightly reduced accuracy versus the 90661 and 90662 Industrial Grade models. The
         &quot;A&quot; model made its appearance in the late 60's.<Br>

         The pictures were supplied by Jere Couch, N4DQ. Jere's unit came in the plastic
         carrying case similar to that shown in the 90652 pictures.<Br>
