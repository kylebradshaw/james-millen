         This device provides a means via direct placement into the audio output of a communications
         receiver to reject or surpress an interfering signal or audio beat note. Thus if
         two CW stations are being received simultaneously the HETROFIL (tm) may be adjusted
         so as to reject either of the signals and accept the other. It may be used externally
         as a separate unit or built into a completed receiver. When used with a receiver
         without the modern type crystal filter it has all of the advantages of the phasing
         control of the crystal circuit and at the same time is much easier and quicker to
         operate. The HETROFIL (tm) may be used with any type receiver and provides a means
         of selective control for TRF receivers comparable to the crystal filter used in
         superhetrodynes and at a much lower cost. A technical paper fully describing this
         device appeared in the September, 1939 issue of QST. Manufactured under license
         from the inventor, Dr. R W Woodward. It is a very simple device based on the Wein
         bridge circuit. Thus it uses no active devices and requires no external nor internal
         DC power source. The whole unit consists of two fixed capacitors, two fixed resistors
         and two ganged potentiometers. The Wein bridge had found extensive use in early
         radio for making both audio and radio frequency measurements. It was reported by
         Dr. Woodward that the idea for using the Wein bridge circuit with these frequency
         measurements that gave him the idea to apply its use in the receiver audio output
         to provide sharp balance or null point adjustments for removing troublesome hetrodyne.<Br>

         The HETROFIL is reported to be the first piece of equipment for the amateur radio
         market manufactured by the Millen Company. Although they were already busy manufacturing
         electronic and mechanical components. The jeweled logo appears only on the early
         versions of this filter. This is the only piece of Millen equipment owned by Don
         Buska, N9OO, that has this type of logo identifier. The HETROFIL was discontinued
         in 1945.<Br>
