         The Millen 92105 is an external replacement IF and audio section dedicated for the
         reception of single-sideband signals. The 92105 was based on a design by J.L.A.
         McLaughlin and appeared in the April 1948 issue of QST magazine. This unit uses
         what is termed a double-oscillator sideband inverter. Basically the user would tap
         the IF signal from their receiver. Usually this was done by simply wrapping insulated
         wire around the plate lead of the detector tube. This IF signal would be mixed with
         either a crystal frequency 50Kc above or below the IF frequency of the receiver.
         The 92105 came delivered for a 455kc IF, but simply changing the crystals to values
         +/- 50Kc from your receivers IF frequency would make this unit operational on just
         about any other receivers IF.<Br>

         After WWII crystal prices were dropping drastically. Military needs brought many
         of crystal manufacturers big business as well as offering new opportunity for start-ups.
         With the war over the competion for sales ment sell cheaper or close your doors.
         Both happened! However, the amateur radio market got the benefit of these price
         reductions and thus a unit like the 92105 could be built, bought and used by hams
         at affordable prices.<Br>

         In 1948 AM was still king in amateur operations. Yes, SSB was coming of age slowly,
         but mainly for the experienced builder and experimenter. In the original QST article
         the author doesn't really address listing to SSB communication, but simply one sideband
         of AM signals. Any one who operates AM today can tell you it doesn't take to many
         AM QSO's to be going on within one of the AM windows to make communications a real
         nightmare! Thus, even in 1948 they were working on making things a little better
         from the communications standpoint by listening to just one of the sidebands. An
         interesting fact that SSB really was addressed on the receiving side before the
         transmission of SSB signals was seeing major popularity in ham circles.<Br>

         Now back to the 92105. The Millen Sideband Selector contained a 50kc IF as a result
         of the aforementioned crystal offset mixing from the receivers IF. Using two tuned
         IF stages at 50Kc the user was able to get very high selectivity needed to receive
         SSB. After the IF was a low level audio amplifier low pass filter stage. The audio
         output would then be feed back into the receivers audio output stage for amplification
         to drive the speaker. The user could also opt for an external audio amplifier and
         speaker system separate from the receiver.<Br>
         <Br>
         You don't see many 92105's around these days. After the article appeared in QST
         Millen had their version in print the very next month. In addition, several radio
         resellers were also touting the Millen unit in their ads. Why it wasn't more popular
         I can not tell you. But perhaps like todays ham's who enjoy AM for it's rich audio
         fidelity that reducing the bandwidth down to a few Kc's was not of much interest.<Br>
