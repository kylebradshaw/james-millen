         Although, this was originally called a &quot;high frequency transmitter&quot; in
         the Millen ads it is by all current standards an HF &amp; VHF transmitter. Primarily
         this transmitter was designed to allow operation up through 2 meters, it came offered
         with plug-in coil assemblies for 20, 10-11, 6 and 2 meters. The transmitter is crystal
         controlled and uses a commerically available Bliley CCO type oscillator assembly.
         A 2E26 is used as a driver/multiplier tube and the final amplifier was a 829B. The
         829B was actually part of an amplifier assembly which Millen sold separately with
         the product number 90811. A separate power supply is required for the transmitter.
         Fully operational it is rated at 75 watts output without forced air cooling.<Br>

         This transmitter appeared on the seen in the late 40's. However, in the 1952 ARRL
         Handbook this product was distinctively marked with a red lettered DISCONTINUED
         across it. My quess was it lacked the necessary TVI (Television Interference) protection.
         The above chassis RF decks are not RF shielded!<Br>
