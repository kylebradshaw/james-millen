         This is the replacement for the 90800 50 Watt transmitter. Based on a transmitter
         design that made its appearance in the December 1952 issue of the ARRL QST Magazine.
         The original Millen schematic indicate a design date of July 1953. As a replacement
         for the 90800 it does have some similarities, such as size, power, number of tubes
         and lack of built in DC power source. However, the similarities end there!<Br>
         <Br>
         Utilizing a 5763 as an oscillator/multiplier circuit feeding a 6146 final amplifier
         the 90801 is capable of 90 watts CW DC input power. Filament and DC voltages are
         supplied by a remote power supply. Two major differences between this transmitter
         and its predecessor is the 90801 uses bandswitched coils vs plug-in coils and has
         been TVI proofed through extensive RF shielding.<Br>
         <Br>
         A companion modulator (90831) was also produced for the 90801 transmitter. The modulator
         is built in a similar sized rack cabinet.<Br>
