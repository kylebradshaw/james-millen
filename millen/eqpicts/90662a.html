         This is a later version of the famous 90651 vacuum tube grid dip meter. It differs
         greatly from the 90651 with the addition of a front rotary switch to select diode
         detector, oscillator and modulator functions and a potentiometer for meter sensitivity
         adjustment. On the top side is a drum dial which is calibrated into seven scales
         for a frequency coverage from 220Kc to 300 Mc. This seven band coverage is achieved
         through plug-in coil assemblies which can be seen in the upper picture. The 90662
         series (90661 also) were considered the Industrial Grade grid-dip meters. They were
         built to higher calibration standards, with each coil being adjusted to each dipper,
         thus providing increased frequency readout accuracy.<Br>

         This wonderful unit belongs to Ed Zeranski. Ed purchased the dipper from Doug Dilley,
         WA6VOV who used it for work on many of his patented antenna designs.<Br>
