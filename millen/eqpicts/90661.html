         The Industrial Grade of the original 90651 Grid-Dip meter. It was built to higher
         accuracy standard versus the 90651 model with the coils sets selected and adjusted
         for each model. The unit show here also sports the low frequency coil set. The metal
         carry case shown here is labeled for a 90662 meter which is also an Industrial Grade
         dipper.<Br>

         This picture was supplied by Steve Russell. The meter was given to him by an &quot;old
         timer&quot; who has now passed on.<Br>
