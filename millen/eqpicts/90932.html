         The 90932 was designed for checking and monitoring transmitter RF output signals
         on a CRT display. However, unlike many popular monitor scopes of the time the Millen
         monitor was much more advanced. First, it contains link-coupled tuned input circuits
         for each of the major ham bands between 3.5 and 54 Mcs. In addition, send-receive
         display blanking and audio phase correction are incorporated.<Br>

         This 90932 belongs to Phil Clements, K5PC. He uses it in conjunction with his 92200
         transmatch. The 92200 has a RF sampling port which allows direct connection to the
         monitors input.<Br>
