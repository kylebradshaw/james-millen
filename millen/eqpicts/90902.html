         The 90902 rack panel oscilloscope was part of a series which included the 90903
         and 90905 models. The last digit of the model number represents the CRT size in
         inches. Thus, the model pictured above has a 2&quot; CRT. These are basic scopes
         comprising the power supply and general brilliancy and focus units. For all practical
         purposes these were used with external sweep units such as the Millen 90921. However,
         as an AM transmitter monitor the user could feed modulated carrier RF into the vertical
         input via a pickup loop and audio modulation voltage to the horizontal input. By
         proper adjustment of levels well known trapezoidal monitoring patterns would result.<Br>
