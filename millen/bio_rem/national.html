                This article is comprehensive with respect to the early National 
                receivers. However, it should be noted that since this was based 
                on a talk given by Ken Conrad and that most of the receivers discussed 
                were those being demonstrated at the time. Therefore, such popular 
                receivers like the FB-7 and the early NC series are not mentioned. 
                With this in mind the reader will still find valuable information 
                contained in this paper that is not found elsewhere.</font>

                <i>The following article was reconstructed by Larry Babcock from 
                a talk given to the Niagara Frontier Wireless Association, (N.F.W.A.) 
                by Ken Conrad in 1983. Kenny was a ardent collector and historian 
                of the National Company prior to his death in the summer of 1988. 
                The National information presented is all from Kenny. The information 
                was preserved by Larry Babcock for this report.<br>
                <br>
                </i>Back in the 1930's the outstanding commerical radio equipment 
                was made by the National Company in Malden, Mass. They had an 
                assortment of sets. Most were for short wave work. They made the 
                SW3, the SW4 and the SW5. The number in the model number was the 
                number of tubes in the set. They were 3 to 5 tubes and all were 
                regenerative. They all had one or two stages of R.F. amplification. 
                The SW3 and SW4 had a single R.F. Stage.<br>
                <br>
                In the early 1930's National also made the AGS which is highly 
                sought by collectors these days. There were only a few ever made. 
                Less accessories, and that means less coils, less power supply, 
                less tubes, less speaker, less everything except the box listed 
                for $180.00. In those days that was a lot of money, more than 
                1/3 the cost of an automobile, so you see why very few were ever 
                made and very few amateurs could ever buy one. Remember in 1932 
                and 1933 there weren't very many dollars around. Only a few affluent 
                hams could buy am AGS.<br>
                <br>
                Back in 1933 the state-of-the-art of short wave reception was 
                very poor compared to nowadays. Most hams had home made two tube 
                regenerative sets with a detector and one stage of audio. A few 
                owned the National SW3 which also had an R.F. stage (plus regenerative 
                detector and an audio stage). The most advanced amateur who has 
                some cash (a few of them did but not me) spent up to $100.00 for 
                a Hammarlund Comet Pro. A lot of people remember this set but 
                it was not very good.<br>
                <br>
                It didn't have an R.F. stage. It had poor selectivity and a superhet 
                was not suited for short wave reception in those days. A good 
                regenerative set like the SW3 could run rings around a superhet 
                with no problem at all! There was a real need for a good superhet 
                like the AGS to be built.<br>
                <br>
                In an article from CQ magazine written by James Millen of National 
                it was stated that &quot;It was in this chilly atmosphere that 
                James Millen who was W1HRX and other engineers of the National 
                Company commenced to design an advanced short wave superhet&quot;. 
                The initial requirement came from the federal government.<br>
                <br>
                The Bureau of Air Commerce which was the predecessor of the present 
                Civil Aeronautics Authority was in the process of replacing the 
                revolving light beacons used for air navigation with a comprehensive 
                ground to air radio network. The communications system was divided 
                into three groups. First, the ground transmitting equipment was 
                to be developed and manufatured by G.E. The airborne radio equipment 
                developed and manufactured by Aircraft Radio Corporation who later 
                developed the SCR 274N. The ground station receivers were designed 
                and manufatured by National. The BAC and National signed a contract 
                to produce several hundred AGS recievers to replace the antiquated 
                sets in use at the time. Incidentally, AGS stands for Aviation 
                Ground Station.<br>
                <br>
                W1HRX started to work on the AGS design and became the leader 
                of development. He didn't have much to go on. His previous experience 
                was the old Browning Drake set of several years previous along 
                with the SW3 and SW5 of National. The problems to get a good short 
                wave set in those days were tremendous.<br>
                <br>
                The first AGS receivers were made on a government contract with 
                a few commercial sets also sold to affluent amateurs. The difference 
                between the contracted ones and those sold on the open market 
                was just in the name plate.<br>
                <br>
                There were only between 200 and 400 sets sold to hams. That was 
                very few even in those days and is why there aren't very many 
                around today. The AGS was very shortly made obsolete by the HRO.</font><font color="Blue" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                (Actually the FB-7 superhet came shortly after the AGS, which 
                was much more affordable and sold in comparatively good quantities. 
                - JMS). </font><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                AGS used a new crystal filter just being developed. It was a single 
                conversion superhet. It had one R.F. and two I.F. stages, an AVC, 
                VFO and audio stages. The crystal filter was available if ordered 
                special. With it the receiver was named the AGSX. Ken Conrad's 
                AGS shown when it first gave this talk to the NFWA was the original 
                type without the crystal filter.<br>
                <br>
                The intermediate frequency was 500 KHz. There is no automatic 
                volume control in this set. None at all. The volume was adjusted 
                only by the bias control potentiometer for the R.F. and I.F. stages. 
                AVC was applied to the first detector, a scheme frowned on today 
                as the ever changing control voltage tends to pull the high frequency 
                oscillator and causes strong signals to flutter but they got around 
                this. In the AGS they injected the local oscillator signal into 
                the plate circuit of the R.F. amplifier and inductively coupled 
                the mixing signal into the first signal. That was how it was done.<br>
                <br>
                Some aspects of the design were amazing. How to control the inductance 
                and capacitance and make the tuned stages all track, that was 
                a real job and to keep it right on the button! They figured that 
                plug in coils were the way to go rather than having the coils 
                permanently wired in. The AGS has five sets of three coils each 
                and on the panel there is a chart which shows the frequency band 
                covered by each set of coils.<br>
                <br>
                This helped the operator pick out the ground station that he wanted 
                to monitor. The tuning capacitors were hand measured. The tuning 
                range and oscillator tracking were corrected by moving a tap on 
                the wire connecting the tuning capacitor to the plug in coil. 
                That was the final adjustment.<br>
                <br>
                Using hand labor for calibration of course is impossible today 
                because of the price of labor but in those days an engineer got 
                a salary of $20- to $40- per week! Imagine that. Technicians earned 
                from 20 to 35 cents an hour. This is why each AGS could be hand 
                calibrated and the chart was right.<br>
                <br>
                The chassis was made of heavy drawn 1/8&quot; think aluminum. 
                The panel is very heavy steel firmly bolted to the chassis. This 
                made a very rigid and absolutely tight assembly. The tuned frequency 
                wouldn't change even if you dropped the set on the floor. The 
                high frequency oscillator is in the middle of the unit and driven 
                by a disk dial.<br>
                <br>
                This receiver has a very unusual dial. It is the same as was later 
                used on the HRO. The dial has five openings and is calibrated 
                from zero to 500. Each time that the dial is turned passed one 
                of the little openings, the scale is automatically changed. The 
                number viewed through the hole jumps another fifty points! Each 
                one of the line segment divisions that just cover a band. You 
                can read to one tenth of a division directly and each division 
                is equivalent to about 1 KHz so you can get down to 100 cycles 
                direct reading. A heck of a lot of the receivers today don't even 
                get near this. Imagine, this was over 50 years ago! The AGS was 
                designed to work forever. You turn one on today and it will work 
                immediately. Even if it has not been operated for fifty years 
                that set will work!<br>
                <br>
                The SW4 and SW5 both had plug in coils. Both were shown when Ken 
                gave this talk to the NFWA. Incidentally, before his death, Kenny 
                donated his entire (large) collection of National receivers to 
                the AWA and they are currently on display in the AWA museum. The 
                SW3 was introduced by National in 1931. It was a low priced set. 
                Because of its very light weight, it was adapted for use by the 
                airlines.<br>
                <br>
                At that time other aircraft receivers were heavy things and didn't 
                perform to well. They had poor selectivity and were bothered by 
                the planes ignition system.<br>
                <br>
                Pan American was about to start flights to South America and needed 
                a very light weight receiver. The only sets available at that 
                time were the National SW4 and SW5. They were too big, too heavy 
                and another problem was that coils would absorb moisture when 
                flying over the ocean. This made the tuned frequency wander all 
                over the place.<br>
                <br>
                In about 1930 the old Boonton Rubber Company started making Bakelite 
                coil form moldings for their sister company the Boonton Radio 
                Company. The molding powder sold by the original Bakelite Corp. 
                was based on the use of wood filler which was very hydroscopic.<br>
                <br>
                Molding in those days was done with steam, not electric heat and 
                as a consequence the molding rooms were extremely humid. The coils 
                forms molded by this process varied tremendously in Q. Good and 
                bad coils looked just alike. You couldn't tell a good coils by 
                looking at it. To solve this problem the Boonton Rubber Co. changed 
                from the old filler to ground mica and electrically heated presses. 
                For the first time this method made uniform inductors. The new 
                material was called R39 and was registered with this trademark. 
                This new material was used in making the SW3 starting in the summer 
                of 1931. During the long and useful life of the SW3 over 10,000 
                sets were made and used by everybody including Pan Am. It is still 
                a good receiver today. The SW3 had tremendous range. You could 
                get coils all the way from 9 to 2000 meters! The SW series sets 
                are collectors items today and they are good ones. They are so 
                stable that you can read sideband on them with no problem!<br>
                <br>
                National used separate power supplies for many years because of 
                the heating problem. With the power supply separate the heat from 
                the transformer and rectifier didn't raise the temperature of 
                the receiver and change the tuned frequency. With everything in 
                the same box the temperature would not stabilize for along time 
                and the frequency would drift until then. The power supply provided 
                about 200 volts to the plates.<br>
                <br>
                Manufacture of the SW3 continued for many years. The original 
                had tubes with 2.5 volt filaments. Later they were made with 6 
                volt tubes and even with metal tubes before production finally 
                folded.<br>
                <br>
                The little National 110</font><font color="Blue" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                (1-10) </font><font
         size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">was also shown 
                when Kenny gave his talk to the NFWA at the Buffalo, NY meeting. 
                The #110 is a four tube super regenerative set. The tuned R.F. 
                amplifier uses a very tiny type 954 tube. The detector was a type 
                955 in a self-quenching super regenerative circuit. It was transformer 
                coupled to the first audi stage, a 6J5. The 6J5 was then resistance 
                coupled to the 6V6 output stage. This was unusual. Kenny said 
                that he didn't know the reason why national designed it this way 
                rather than using transformer coupling for the added gain, but 
                that was the way it was.<br>
                <br>
                The model 110 had six separate pairs of small clear plastic coils. 
                They are extremely small and so shaped that they can be picked 
                up and plugged in very easily. If you picked them up by the coil 
                itself it would probably collapse because they are so small and 
                delicate. This set will get down to 300MHz. It tunes the one to 
                ten meter band and it will get down to one meter. This was a long 
                time ago too, way back in the fortys. (I liked the way Kenny said 
                &quot;down to 300 MHz&quot; rather than up to 300 MHz. Here's 
                a man who still thought in terms of wave length rather than frequency 
                like us young guys!).<br>
                <br>
                The model 110 had a separate A.C. power supply or could be operated 
                with batteries. The manual didn't give the price but did have 
                charts giving the frequency coverage for each set of plug in coils. 
                It also had the same unusual tuning dial that was first used on 
                the AGS.<br>
                <br>
                The HRO is my favorite receiver. Some of the commercial airlines 
                used the National AGS, but others wanted a little better receiver. 
                They wanted one for CW that could also work with the new Western 
                Electric phone transmitters (voice) that were about to be installed 
                in aircraft.<br>
                <br>
                Now consider the state of the art in 1933 and 1934. The great 
                majority of hams had home made regenerative sets or SW3's. A superhet 
                was useless, they thought, for CW and pretty poor on general shortwave. 
                It was considered a great thing to get anything on a short wave 
                superhet so National started to develop the HRO. It was a coordinated 
                effort. This receiver as developed on the east coast and the west 
                coast of the U.S. at the same time! There was 3000 miles separating 
                the mechanical and electrical teams! Wasn't that crazy? Wow. The 
                west coast HRO team was coordinated by Herbert Hoover Jr.. James 
                Millen was in charge of the east coast. They were in a hurry.<br>
                <br>
                The tool makers required a job number for their overtime slips. 
                Since none had been assigned, they took it upon themselves to 
                use the initials &quot;H&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;R&quot;, or 
                &quot;HOR&quot; abbreviated from &quot;Hell of a Rush!&quot; since 
                that was the state of affairs. Now known as the HOR the new prototype 
                was carried by Millen to Pasadena for circuit revision. Bugs were 
                worked out. It was a success. By this time however, some of the 
                participants had doubts about the name. So they therefore renamed 
                it the HRO. This change was made just in time to catch the first 
                ad in December 1934 QST.<br>
                <br>
                But I have digressed from my story. Getting back to the design, 
                Herb Hoover, Jr. set up an experimental laboratory in his garage 
                under the direction of Howard Morgan of Western Electric. Howard 
                and his technicians went to work developing a circuit based on 
                experience gained with the AGS and what the airlines were looking 
                for. First the specifications were established. It had to have 
                superior image rejection which called for two stages of R.F., 
                not just one. The selectivity would require a crystal filter be 
                included. Jim Millen had designed what they called a epicyclic 
                dial so you could read to one part in five hundred. In other words 
                the band spread on that dial was over 12 feet on a ham band!<br>
                <br>
                The specifications for the HRO also required very good AVC and 
                an S meter. The designers believed that plug in coils were the 
                answer. They didn't want band switching and instead planned to 
                have a new four bank plug in coil catacomb. Each coil deck had 
                its own calibration chart. To reduce hum and heating effects the 
                power supply was separate. As a whole, the receiver was years 
                ahead of its time. It is one of the first examples of system designed 
                equipment otherwise unknown before World War II.<br>
                <br>
                The HRO was very outstanding, a classic. It had two R.F. stages, 
                a crystal filter, two I.F. stages, AVC, BFO and 450 degrees band 
                spread on any amateur band!<br>
                <br>
                There was a system built into the catacombs. Each coil had two 
                little screw holes with little machine screws in them. If you 
                put the screw in to the hole on the left you get general coverage. 
                When you remove the other one you get just the ham band over the 
                whole dial. It was simple. The screws just shorted a condenser 
                or opened one across part of the coil. But it worked and it gave 
                trememdous band spread!<br>
                <br>
                At first there was a lot of drift but in working on the problem 
                they found out that most of the drift was in the oscillator tube 
                and they were able to eliminate the problem. The HRO was so beautifully 
                made that it would be impossible to build today. It would cost 
                hundreds of dollars just to make the coil forms, the tuning condensers 
                and the insulators. There was so much hand work in both the mechanical 
                and electrical calibration.<br>
                <br>
                One of the early owners of the HRO was Charlie Kolster. He was 
                so impressed with the set that he suggested that Jim Millen replace 
                his old two district call sign with a first district and have 
                1HRO in honor of the set. But the FCC goofed and he ended up with 
                1HRX</font><font color="Blue" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                (I believe that the &quot;W&quot; letter prefix was already in 
                existance at this time so these calls should be preceded with 
                that letter - JMS.)</font><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                That was how the FCC did things. In spite of the call sign mix 
                up, the set was an instant success.<br>
                <br>
                Braniff Airlines bought a lot of HRO receivers. The set was so 
                far ahead of time that they found it could be operated unattended. 
                They installed a lot of HRO receivers on telephone poles spaced 
                50 miles apart. That way they could get the coverage to communicate 
                with airplanes all along the route. At that time there was no 
                radar, or beacons or anything. So they mounted HRO's in boxes 
                on poles every 50 miles along the main route of the aircraft. 
                These receivers ran continuously 24 hours a day! They were tuned 
                to thirty one hundred and five kilocycles (KHz) which was the 
                aircraft frequency.<br>
                <br>
                The receiever outputs were patched into land lines and could be 
                monitored in Kansas City, Dallas, Tulsa, Oklahoma City or anywhere. 
                They had continuous voice monitor of the planes all along the 
                route. That's where the HRO got the big impetus. Also, the Howard 
                Hughes flight around the world used the HRO. He had two at each 
                ground station. That is what he thought of the HRO!<br>
                <br>
                The HRO was so designed that with the crystal filter, now this 
                is almost unbelievable, you could get down to 20 cycles! (Hz) 
                That's the selectivity of the HRO., twenty cycles! (Not kilocycles) 
                That is better than practically any set made today, and this was 
                over fifty years ago.<br>
                <br>
                The HRO remained popular until after World War II. By then SSB 
                was coming in and the HRO was finally on the downgrade. That is 
                the story of the HRO. It was a wonderful set. I don't care what 
                they make today, what the price is or anything, they don't make 
                them to have the design, the selectivity and the durability! After 
                fifty years I can turn one on and she'll still go. They are worth 
                the time and effort to restore.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Question:</b><br>
                Ken did anyone ever make a rack mounted HRO like your AGS?<br>
                <br>
                <b>Answer:</b><br>
                Yes, And they were provided with a door to slide the coils in 
                and out of the set.</font>
