                following is an excerpt of a letter received from Hank Van Cleef 
                relating to his work at the James Millen Company in the late 50's. 
                I have edited the text to make it more understandable to the readers 
                of this page.</font><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

              <p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
                far as working for Millen goes, that was a long time ago, 1956-7, 
                which is 42-43 years now. I worked in what was known as &quot;the 
                lab&quot; for Wade Caywood, and with Dick Freeman. We had several 
                co-ops from Northeastern come and go, who provided technician 
                labor beyond what the three of us did. I don't remember Jim Millen 
                at all. He did not come out our way very often, and I don't think 
                he spent much time at 150 Exchange St.</font> 
              <p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                joke that the place was a real &quot;garage operation.&quot; It 
                was the second floor over a Pontiac dealer. I was surprised at 
                how small the place really was, after having worked for Packard.</font> 
              <p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
                don't see mention of Phil Eyrick in other documents about the 
                Millen Company, and often only passing mention to Fran Bearse. 
                Phil went to work for Millen at National Co. and was the one who 
                did the mechanical design on the NC-100 sliding coil trays. He 
                came over with Millen in '39 and was nominally &quot;general manager&quot; 
                while I was there, although spent most of his time expediting 
                orders of one thing or another. He wasn't in very good health; 
                had a heart condition, and, I think, was out of the place shortly 
                after I left.</font> 
              <p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fran 
                Bearse really ran the place. She was always &quot;Miss Bearse&quot; 
                to me. Just about anything that happened in that company went 
                through her, and if you needed something, it was &quot;talk to 
                Miss Bearse,&quot; although Phil handled things like salaries 
                and raises. I have forgotten who told me, or exactly when it was, 
                but I think it was just before I went to Tektronix in '60 that 
                she went into her office one afternoon to take a nap, and never 
                woke up. After that, Wade Caywood had the titles and essentially 
                ran the place.</font> 
              <p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wade 
                was hired fresh out of MIT in '39. Howard Green, who ran the coil 
                winding shop, I think was there at the start, along with Phil 
                and a couple of tool and diemakers who were real craftsmen. Millen 
                was a mechanical man, and while he was a ham, I don't think he 
                did much if any electrical design work himself. Dick Freeman was 
                a co-op from the early fifties who stayed with Millen after he 
                graduated. I don't know what Millen did for those folks when he 
                closed the doors. The place was pretty much a components operation 
                when I was there, with a few runs of various assembled products, 
                principally, the grid dips. There were a whole bunch of &quot;RCA&quot; 
                (made by Millen) 158 and 160 scopes that were in the lab---maybe 
                ten of them---and we used a couple in test jigs. When one conked 
                out, we'd put a tag on it with a tentative diagnosis, then look 
                at the others and see which ones could be fixed, and they were 
                all pretty tired old soldiers. Also, some uncalibrated BC-221's 
                from a production run, and the most serious scope was a P-4 from 
                a WWII run that had, I think, a Sylvania nameplate. But the core 
                of the business in the mid-fifties was mechanical components, 
                magnetic delay lines (all wound on one machine by one skilled 
                operator), and coil products. Most of my work was with coils, 
                and I worked pretty closely with Howard Green most of the time.

<p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Probably the stuff you've gotten from others, and 
                particularly the articles, are much more comprehensive and balanced 
                than anything I could add. To say that I was pretty junior at 
                the time is an understatement, and working there was quite an 
                education. What I still find suprising is that a small loft-garage 
                operation like that could have been such a large presence in electronics 
                for as long as it was. All of their products were quality stuff, 
                and the Millen name was presold through the industry.</font>
