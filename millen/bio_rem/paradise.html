                picture of the owner and operator of the station we are about 
                to describe, it may be desireable to tell you something about 
                the gentleman himself. His contributions to the radio art are 
                quite generally recognized in that field but his personal characteristics 
                are known to only a limited few with whom he comes in contact 
                in the course of business or with whom he converses on the air. 
                Of course, for the past three years, the National Company's rather 
                intimate conversational page, written by Mr. Millen and published 
                in QST, has given most of us, in the amateur game, some inkling 
                of his ability and personality, to say nothing of some very valuable 
                engineering facts.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Jim,&quot; as he is generally known by the radio fraternity 
                is a very modest, unassuming sort of gentleman who hates hustle 
                and bustle and noise in a profound fashion. The &quot;M.E.&quot; 
                which follows his name, is a degree which he received from the 
                Steven's Institute of Technology, at Hoboken, New Jersey. He was 
                most fortunate in having , amoung his instructors at Steven's 
                the now famous Professor Hazeltine, of neutrodyne fame, as well 
                as Professor Vreeland, whose valuable contributions in connection 
                with band-pass tuning have done so much for high-fidelity radio 
                reception.<br>
                <br>
                At the time, Jim lived with his mother at Elmhurst, Long Island. 
                The trek from Elmhurst to Hoboken was in those days, something 
                which would not be envied by the present-day college man. While 
                it is generally considered that getting through Steven's is no 
                cinch, Millen found time to prepare magazine articles which started 
                appearing in<i> Radio Broadcast . </i>In addition, to his technical 
                pursuits, he found sufficient time weekends to build for himself, 
                and with very little help, a bungalow at High Hill Beach, which 
                is now a part of the famous Jones' Beach State Park. All of the 
                wood for the bungalow had to be transported by boat from the mainland 
                to the little dock at High Hill Beach, and from there it was toted 
                piece-meal to the bungalow's location, a little over a mile away.<br>
                <br>
                After the bingalow was completed, battery-operated radio equipment 
                was installed and some remarkable results were obtained with extremely 
                long antennas stretched along the beach.<br>
                <br>
                However, that is an entirely different story and our principal 
                point in mentioning it is that the owner of the &quot;Paradise&quot; 
                we are about to describe is a person who has a certain amount 
                of push, and who understands that only by having such seclusion 
                is it possible to secure the kind of radio results that all of 
                us would like to obtain.<br>
                <br>
                <b>The Hilltop Haven</b><br>
                <br>
                The hilltop on which Mr. Millen's present station is located just 
                north of Middleton, Massachusetts. It is considerable distance 
                from either homes and one of the highest spots in the Boston area.<br>
                <br>
                The hilltop is reached by dirt roads which branch off the main 
                thoroughfare passing a half mile in either direction from the 
                top of the hill. The dirt roads have the character of mountain 
                trails and would be ideal for Rocky Mountain goats. Among other 
                things, the property includes a large sized pond, a very pretty 
                brook and a pine grove, which puts one in mind of the redwood 
                tree area in the far west.<br>
                <br>
                The main house is a white colonial, located on a small plateau, 
                near the top of the hill. It was built 200 years ago and some 
                of the boards in the floors and the roof are thirty inches wide. 
                It has been modernized by Mr. Millen and his mother to the extent 
                of incorporating a most up-to-date bathroom and kitchen. This 
                modernization has been done so skillfully that the New England 
                colonial atmosphere of the dwelling has been preserved.<br>
                <br>
                On a clear day, the Customs House, at Boston, some twenty-eight 
                miles away, may be seen from the front porch. The Porch, too, 
                provides a view of the excellent swimming pool, some hundred feet 
                down the slope.<br>
                <br>
                The bungalow, shown in the general view of the hilltop, is the 
                radio station itself, and is approximately one-hundred yards away 
                from the main house. The house itself is located to the left of 
                the bungalow and the swimming pool is located quite close to the 
                grape arbor which appears in the lower left-hand corner of the 
                general picture. There is an extension on the side of the bungalow, 
                not in view in the picture, which has recently been added and 
                which serves as a bedroom, with twin beds, for the accommodation 
                of visiting radio amateurs who insist on staying up all hours 
                to work the rig. The provision of this bedroom in the bungalow 
                makes it unnecessary for the visiting brass-pounders and voice-throwers 
                to wake up the remainder of the household when they do decide 
                to go to bed, and it has the distinct advantage of enabling them 
                to sleep late in the morning, without being aroused by those who 
                would care to be about in the main house.<br>
                <br>
                <b>The Antennas</b><br>
                <br>
                The mast sticking up from the chimney supports a short antenna 
                which is used for local reception and particularly for operation 
                on five meters. The large frame-work tower in the center of the 
                picture and the cumbersome contraption which it supports, reminds 
                one of the rotary aerial swings that one finds at seaside resorts 
                and at county fairs. Actually, it is a 20-meter, four element 
                beam antenna. Signals from this beam have been heard in all parts 
                of the world.<br>
                <br>
                The original plan for this antenna called for a motor, located 
                at the top of the tower, to be used for rotating the beam. This 
                refinement was never completed, however, as the particular stations 
                with which W1HRX maintains regular schedules can all be worked 
                from the same orientation of the array. Details concerning the 
                manner in which the beam antenna has been made are discernable 
                in the large, close-up picture of the beam itself.</font><font color="Blue" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                (This close up doesn't appear on this website, but the array is 
                visable in the bungalow picture - JMS) </font><font
         size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two of the elements are feed in phase from a 600-ohm line and 
                there are two parasitic reflectors behind the radiators.<br>
                <br>
                As is true with every amateur station, each of the important components 
                here is surrounded by an interesting story. Take, for instance, 
                the five meter, eight-element beam array shown supported by the 
                frame-work at the left of the picture. Before this workmanlike 
                unit appeared, all sorts of makeshift arrangements, of the same 
                general dimensions, were tried and found to be practically useless. 
                The headquarters staff of QST wanted to carry on some experimental 
                work, in connection with long-distance transmission on five meters. 
                Millen's hilltop is about 128 miles from Hartford and it was thought 
                that this distance would be ideal for the experiments. Accordingly, 
                after the preliminary aerial had been abandoned, the unit shown 
                in the picture was built. The results obtained with this antenna 
                are now well known to nearly every amateur, and consistent day 
                and night transmissions between this beam and a similar unit installed 
                at Hartford were carried on for over a year.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Headaches</b><br>
                <br>
                While W1HRX now appears to be close to ideal it must not be thought 
                that this station has come into being without any of the aggravating 
                circumstances which the rest of us encounter. A very severe headache 
                was caused during the construction of the lattice work mast which 
                appears prominently in the general view of the station. The four 
                corner supports are made of 4 by 4 pine joists in a single length. 
                It was found that units of this size, 34 feet long, could be obtained 
                at a local lumber yard. Operating on the basis of this length, 
                complete drawings for the entire tower were made. Later, a piece 
                of lumber, 38 feet long, and measuring 8 by 8, was located. At 
                no small cost, it was cut up into four pieces, 4 by 4 and 38 feet 
                long. Millen was perfectly willing to pay the premium for the 
                additional four feet of height. On his arrival to the &quot;farm&quot; 
                that evening you can imagine his distress when he found four pieces 
                of 4 by 4,<i> four feet long</i>, lying on the barn floor. He 
                was advised that the carpenter had cut them off the long length 
                so that the tower would coincide with the drawings which had been 
                made.<br>
                <br>
                Even after this catastrophe, troubles continued to hover about. 
                It was difficult to secure a supporting member for the vertical 
                radiator which would have the dual characteristics of strength 
                and lightness. Ultimately, after a two weeks wait, four 30 foot 
                bamboo poles were secured in New York, and it must be said that 
                30-foot bamboo poles are not especially easy to find. Nor is it 
                easy to ship then without having them broken, after they have 
                been found.<br>
                <br>
                <b>The Station</b><br>
                <br>
                Two thoughts guided the securing of the &quot;Hilltop&quot; which 
                is now so well known to most amateurs as Radio Station W1HRX. 
                One was Millen's desire to secure a summer retreat, where his 
                friends could be suitably entertained and where a reasonable degree 
                of privacy could be had. The second and perhaps the more important 
                reason was that he is a firm believer in the policy of giving 
                everything a very thorough trial under severely practical conditions, 
                and he wanted a place where new ideas and new equipment could 
                be put through their paces unhurriedly.<br>
                <br>
                Nearly all of the equipment carried in the right-hand relay rack, 
                shown in the corner of the operating room, is useful for receiving 
                only. Certain tricks in this layout, however, are not immediately 
                apparent. The power supply for the exciters is located at the 
                base of the relay rack, in such a position that the operator can 
                throw the toggle switch on and off with his foot without reaching 
                down. Provision of a wooden shelf, directly beneath the receiver, 
                eliminates the necessity for an extra table or a desk for operating 
                purposes. It will be observed that the log, key and microphone 
                are right at the operator's elbow. The space between this shelf 
                and the top of the power supply was formerly occupied by nothing 
                but blank panels. By the simple expedient of employing a few metal 
                shelves which are attached directly to the relay rack, which was 
                formerly dead space, makes all of the necessary equipment immediately 
                available and at the same time provides a place for ash trays, 
                tall glasses, etc., where they'll not be easily upset.<br>
                <br>
                The power lines do not reach this station. In order to energize 
                the rather powerful equipment which is used here, it is therefore 
                necessary to generate power on the hilltop. Several power plants 
                are available. A &quot;Windcharger&quot; was mounted on the peak 
                of the barn roof about two years ago and it has been doing active 
                duty ever since. It takes care of some of the emergency lighting 
                in the main house by keeping a bank of storage batteries, located 
                in the barn, fully charged at all times. These storage batteries 
                are also used for starting the gasoline engine which drives the 
                intermediate power supply and which is located a considerable 
                distance away from the house. This gas engine drives an alternator 
                which is used for light and for operation of one of the lower 
                powered transmitters. It is also employed in connection with a 
                pump, used to draw water from a spring and pump in into a huge 
                tank located directly behind the barn.<br>
                <br>
                In addition to the transmitter shown in one of the accompanying 
                pictures, another and very much more powerful unit is located 
                in another corner of the room and is link-coupled to the transmitter 
                shown here. With this higher powered final amplifier it is possible 
                for the station to be run to the full legal limit.<br>
                <br>
                The installation of the gasoline-driven generator, which is located 
                just outside the windows in the operating room, was a task of 
                no mean proportions, in spite of the fact that Millen had the 
                very valuable assistance of Fred Davis, who is the General manager 
                of the Rumford Press, among whose tasks are the printing and distriburtion 
                of the <i>Reader's Digest</i>. The very important work of assisting 
                in attaching the fireproof covering for the gas engine into the 
                operating room, were delegated to Davis and your present reporter.</font></td>
