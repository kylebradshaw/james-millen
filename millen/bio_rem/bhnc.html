                story of how a small manufacturer of power plant specialty items, 
                and later toys and household items, became one of the leading 
                manufacturers of amateur, commercial and military short-wave communications 
                equipment is interesting and fascinating. As we will see, it was 
                not planned that way; it just happened!<br>
                <br>
                In 1879 Edison invented the electric light bulb. This created 
                a large demand for electrical energy. Charles Steinmetz and George 
                Westinghouse solved the mysteries of alternating current which 
                permitted large amounts of electrical energy to be transmitted 
                over long distances. This, in turn, created a need for large power 
                generating stations. By the early 1900's the design and construction 
                of power generating stations was, in today's terminology, an emerging 
                industry.<br>
                <br>
                At the turn of the century, one of the leading power plant construction 
                companies was, and still is, the Stone and Webster Co. who then 
                had their headquarters in the Boston, Massachusetts area.<br>
                <br>
                Power plants required many hardware specialty items which were 
                new and unique and for which no regular suppliers had yet established 
                themselves. Three mechanical engineers from Stone and Webster 
                recognized this market and set up a company on a part-time basis 
                to design and manufacture these hardware items.<br>
                <br>
                A material called transite was widely used at that time to make 
                switching and transformer vaults for power plants. Transite is 
                sheet material, similar to plywood except that the base material 
                is asbestos which is noncombustable and a nonconductor of electricity.<br>
                <br>
                The power plant specialty business had one serious drawback; while 
                the market with Stone and Webster was quaranteed, it was sporadic. 
                Stone and Webster did not receive new construction contracts every 
                day and there were long gaps between contracts when there was 
                no demand for the specialty items A search was therefore made 
                for products which they could manufacture using the production 
                tools they has for which a steady demand existed.<br>
                <br>
                One of the three knew a toy buyer for the F.W. Woolworth Company; 
                so they went into the toy business.<br>
                <br>
                I have not been able to pinpoint the date when the three actually 
                began manufacturing power plant items or when they began manufacturing 
                toys but it was in the 1910-14 period. On October 23, 1914 they 
                incorporated in Massachusetts as the National Toy Company. The 
                initial capitalization was $1000; $700 in cash and $300, which 
                was the evaluation placed on a patent for &quot;talking machine 
                toys.&quot; The incorporators were Warren Hopkins, Walter Balke, 
                and Rosewell Douglass. Hopkins had the most money and the controlling 
                interest in the company and always &quot;called the shots&quot; 
                until his death in the early 1940's, even though he retained his 
                position at Stone and Webster; in fact, Hopkins later became president 
                of Stone and Webster Engineering Co. In the early toy days the 
                company was run by Roswell Douglass; he died in the late 'teens 
                and William Ready became the chief operating officer. He also 
                took Douglass' place as a stock holder.<br>
                <br>
                The toy business was highly successful; in June 1916, sixteen 
                months after incorporating, the company had grossed over $33,000 
                and paid over $8,000 to Balke, Hopkins and Douglass. This is better 
                than a ten-to-one return on their $700 cash investment is sixteen 
                months and would be considered good even today, but these were 
                pre-WWI dollars. The toys were sold through such wellknown stores 
                as F.A.O. Schwarz, Jordan Marsh, Wm. Filene, John Wanamaker, and 
                Gimbels Bros., as well as through Victor and Columbia Talking 
                Machine dealers. Over 8,800 of these toys were sold between January 
                and June of 1916 and the company planned to make 16,000 more during 
                the remainder of 1916. The early talking machine (phonograph) 
                toys were designed by Walter Balke, who was very ingenious mechanically; 
                the toys were attached to the turntable of a phonograph and were 
                activated by the record being played on the phonograph. For example, 
                'REX the Magnetic Dog' was controlled by a resonant reed. When 
                this reed was activated by the proper note on the record, REX 
                would jump out of his kennel. 'The Magnetic Dancers' were small 
                figures of dancers with steel bases that would glide on an opaque 
                glass plate over aspecial record on the phonograph containing 
                small cobalt magnetics. These would cause the dancers to glide 
                around the 'dance floor.' Another series were the 'Wireless Pups' 
                which I have not seen described. There was also an entire family 
                of 'Ragtime Rastus' dancers including Boxers and Uncle Sam and 
                Mex. These were loose jointed wooden figures that would dance 
                or box on top of a revolving turntable. By choosing a record with 
                the proper beat, a very entertaining effect could be obtained.<br>
                <br>
                This Success apparently created the need for additional working 
                capital and it was proposed to issue $5,000 worth of preferred 
                stock to be purchased by the present stock holders. The reasons 
                for this are interesting:<br>
                <br>
                <i>&quot;New things are constantly being brought to us, many of 
                them specialties not in the toy line (for instance a mattress 
                for children's cribs and hospitals which can be readily taken 
                apart, washed and aired, as well as other household specialties). 
                In order that we may take up the manufacture of any profitable 
                specialty, we shall probably when increasing the capital stock 
                change the name to The National Company or other suitable name 
                that will not limit us to toys.&quot;<br>
                </i><br>
                I have not been able to determine when that was written or when 
                the name was actually changed but I believe it was in lat 1916. 
                On February 16, 1932 the corporation charter was further amended 
                to formally change the company name to the National Company, Inc. 
                by which name the company is generally remembered. Note that the 
                word &quot;Company&quot; is part of the name and should be spelled 
                out as is the word National. The expression National Co., Inc. 
                is incorrect.<br>
                <br>
                When the United Sates entered World War Im the company made airplane 
                parts and thread gauges for the war effort. At the conclusion 
                of the war National went back to making power plant items, toys 
                and as an added line, household items.<br>
                <br>
                By the end of March 1923 the National inventory included fourteen 
                items: T.M. Toys, Magnetic Dancers, Robert Mixers, DMB Covers, 
                Victrolene, Wall Rack and Plan Holders, Radio Components, S. Santry, 
                Holophane, Thompson Spa, Portalite, H. Electric Lt, Co. Doble 
                and Miscellaneous. I can only identify about three of them.</font>

                In the early 1920's several radio stations began regularly scheduled 
                broadcasting and the public craze was to build radio receivers. 
                The leading variable capacitor (condensor in those days) manufacturer 
                at the time was Allen D. Cardwell, and Cardwell was not able to 
                keep up with the demand. Cardwell's representative in the Boston 
                area - George Q. Hill - was unhappy since he worked on commission 
                and his income was limited by Cardwell's deliveries. Hill recognized 
                the demand for variable capacitors and looked around for alternate 
                sources. The management of National was always interested in new 
                products and were eager to profit from the new radio craze. In 
                1922 they began supplying variable capacitors to Hill who sold 
                them as fast as National could make them. When National later 
                entered the radio business, Hill became the sales manager for 
                radio products.<br>
                <br>
                In 1924, two engineers from Harvard University, Fred H. Drake 
                and Glenn Browning, developed the Browning Drake tuner which was 
                &quot;guaranteed&quot; to improve radio reception; Browning and 
                Drake approached National to manufacture the tuner. The radio 
                editor of the Christian Science Monitor, Vulney Hurd, liked the 
                Browning Drake tuner and gave it extensive publicity in his weekly 
                newspaper column, so that the tuner soon became a very popular 
                item. The National Company decided to make the design, manufacture 
                and sales of radio equipment and components their principal line 
                of business, and began looking around for someone knowledgeable 
                in the fledging radio field to join the company and lead them.<br>
                <br>
                In 1924 Hopkins, Ready and Balke were on a business trip to Garden 
                City, Long Island where they were introduced to James Millen. 
                Millen's father had recently died while the younger Millen was 
                a mechanical engineering student at the Stevens Institute of Technology 
                in Hoboken, N.J. In order to finish college, Millen began writing 
                magazine articles on radio topics. For example, a &quot;Dear Abbey&quot; 
                type column on radio topics regularly appeared in Doubleday's 
                <i>Radio Broadcast</i> magazine in which Millen answered questions 
                from readers on their radio problems.<br>
                <br>
                Millen had begun writing at an early age. He had his first item 
                published when he was 15 in the October 1916 issue of Popular 
                Science Monthly; it showed how any home work shop could have a 
                small anvil. Staple an old fashioned flat-iron upside down to 
                the edge of the work bench. It sounds like a good idea, even today, 
                if you can find an old fashioned flat iron!<br>
                <br>
                Because of his writing, Millen had aquired a considerable reputation 
                in radio and had built up an extensive consulting practice which 
                included CECO in Providance, R.I. and the Spencer brothers in 
                the Boston area who had just established the American Appliance 
                Co., which was later to become Raytheon. When Millen graduated 
                in 1926 he began working for National on a consulting basis and 
                in 1927 dropped his other consulting contracts and began working 
                for them full time as Chief Engineer and General Manager. His 
                goal was to firmly establish the National Company in the radio 
                business.<br>
                <br>
                In 1926 the National Company needed to expand its manufacturing 
                facilities and acquired the factory building at 61 Sherman Street, 
                Malden, Massachusetts, formerly owned by the Cub Knitting Mills. 
                Cub had gone bankrupt and their factory had been put on the auction 
                block. The attorney who was suppose to appear at the auction to 
                set the minimum acceptable bid did not show up so the building 
                went to National for about ten cents on the dollar.<br>
                <br>
                National's first offering under Millen's guidance included a Type 
                L-3 two-stage audio power amplifier and battery eliminator which 
                was developed in collaboration with Arthur Lynch, a Model E-1 
                single stage audio amplifier and battery eliminator, and a Model 
                M battery eliminator. These were announced late in 1927.<br>
                <br>
                In 1929, in collaboration with Glenn Browning, National announced 
                the MB-29 broadcast band tuner which consisted of three stages 
                of rf amplification and bandpass tuning. In 1930 an improved model, 
                the MB-30, consisting of four stages of rf amplification, was 
                advertised. These were both TRF models.</font>

                  The Regenerative Receivers</b></font> 
                </center>
              <p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                National's first short wave receiver was the SW-2 (stands for 
                Short-Wave, 2 tubes) consisting of an intuned rf amplifer and 
                a regenerative detector. The basic design was obtained from the 
                RCA Communications Laboratory, then located at Van Cordtland Park, 
                New York City. Several of Millen's college classmates had gone 
                to work for RCA and he had extensive contacts there. The SW-2 
                was based on a receiver design RCA developed for an &quot;export 
                receiver&quot; sold by the General Electric Co. in South America. 
                This receiver became known as the SW-4 when it was later manufactured 
                by National.<br>
                <br>
                The SW-2 was the only receiver National made without sheet metal 
                or production tooling; for example, all holes were laid out by 
                hand instead of using fixtures. The SW-2 was extensively advertised 
                as a TV receiver and Millen wrote an article in the November 1928 
                issue of Radio News describing his TV experiments. The SW-2 appeared 
                in late 1927 or early 1928. A three-tube version of the SW-2 appeared 
                in 1929; the third tube was an voltage amplifier and apparently 
                was added to provide additional amplification for TV work.<br>
                <br>
                In 1929 the company produced the four-tube SW-4, the fourth tube 
                being an audio power output tube. A sheet metal cabinet was also 
                provided.<br>
                <br>
                As new and improved vacuum tubes were devloped, National improved 
                its receivers. In 1930 Millen and Kruse, who was a former technical 
                editor of QST, designed the SW-5 receiver. The fifth tube was 
                added to provide a push-pull output stage for loud speaker operation. 
                This was one of the first short-wave receivers specifically designed 
                for operation from AC power lines. The receiver was completely 
                hum-free and had no dead spots which was quite an accomplishment 
                at that time. A &quot;high fidelity&quot; version of the same 
                receiver - the SW-45 - was also sold which used type 45 tubes 
                for the audio output stage instead of the type 27 used in the 
                SW-5.<br>

                As the country was in the midst of the great depression, a low-cost 
                version of the SW-5 was soon developed - the now venerable SW-3. 
                The push-pull audio output stage of the SW-5 was eliminated - 
                which meant headphone operation only - and a wrap-around sheet 
                metal cabinet was substituted to further reduce costs. Both AC 
                and battery powered models of the SW-3 were marketed and two upgrades 
                made; the last right after WWII to use octal tubes. This receiver 
                was in production almost 15 years, from 1933 to 1948, the longest 
                production run of any receiver except the HRO which was in production 
                for almost 30 years. The SW-3 has become a &quot;must&quot; for 
                any collector of early short-wave receivers.<br>
                <br>
                One last regenerative receiver deserves mention, the SW-58C. This 
                receiver was designed as a companion receiver for the AGS superheterodyne 
                receiver to cover the 200 to 400 Khz frequency range used by the 
                airlines that the AGS receiver would not cover. The receiver is 
                basically the SW-58 except for the plug-in coils. These coils 
                look like the coils used for the AGS/FB-7 receivers but they are 
                longer and smaller in diameter. They are NOT interchangeable with 
                the AGS/FB-7 coils. The SW-58C has a National type N dial, as 
                did the AGS; the SW-58C is generally seen in AGS advertisments 
                as the 'other' receiver in the relay rack.</font>

                In 1932 the General Electric Co. was awarded a contract by the 
                recently established Civil Aeronautics Authority (known as the 
                FAA today) to provide short-wave (HF in today's terminology) transmitters 
                and receivers to the Government for air safety use in the fledgling 
                airline industry. GE had developed a transmitter but they did 
                not have a receiever. The Western Electric Company had a receiver, 
                but for competitive reasons GE did not want to team with Western 
                Electric and instead approached Millen to have National design 
                and manufacture a suitable receiver. The result was the AGS (for 
                Aeronautical Ground Station). This was the first high performance 
                short-wave receiver made by National and one of the first high 
                performance receivers commerically available. Most of the receivers 
                were sold to the CAA through General Electric Co. A few went into 
                the amateur market along with amateur band-spread coils.<br>
                <br>
                Again the depression reared its head and in order to make the 
                receiver more marketable a reduced version was made available; 
                this was called the FB-7. The rf preselector was eliminated and 
                a more economical wrap-around sheet metal cabinet was provided; 
                only one set of coils was included so that the cost was reduced 
                to where many amateurs could afford what was probably the first 
                medium performance amateur superhet receiver. The receiver became 
                very popular among amateurs and is among collector, too.</font>

                After the introduction of the AGS by the Government, the airline 
                industry itself began to recognize the importance of reliable 
                radio communication and urged National to develop a receiver for 
                their use. Herbert Hoover, Jr was then in charge of radio communications 
                for Western Airlines (which later became part of TWA); he acted 
                as an informal spokesman for the airlines. The main airline requirements 
                were that if plug-in coils were necessary to obtain the desired 
                performance, then all coils must be plugged in simultaneously. 
                A second requirement was two stages of preselection. As these 
                requirements, plus a crystal filter, closely matched those desired 
                by the amateur community for their dream receiver, the two markets 
                could be combined into one receiver which became known as the 
                HRO. By the way, HRO stands for Helluva Rush Order, honestly! 
                How it got that name is part of the HRO story which is too long 
                to include here.<br>
                <br>
                The HRO was first announced in the October 1934 issue of QST and 
                delivery was promissed for December 1934 in time for the Christmas 
                trade. The photograph shown in that announcement is the prototype 
                model which did not go into production. However, technical problems 
                delayed deliveries until March 1935; the photograph shown in the 
                January issue of QST is that of the first production model. The 
                same basic receiver stayed in continuous production almost thirty 
                years until October 1964 when the HRO-500 was announced. This 
                is a remarkable life span for any piece of electronic equipment, 
                especially one that was designed so early in the electronics age.<br>
                <br>
                In February 1936 National announced the HRO Jr., a scaled down 
                version of the HRO, at a cost of just under $100. The advertised 
                economics were effected by removing the crystal filter, the S-meter 
                and by supplying only one coil set, without bandspread, to cover 
                any two contiguous amateur bands. One further economy was not 
                advertised; with the HRO Sr. each coil set was aligned in the 
                receiver with which it was sold. This of course, gave an exact 
                alignment of each coil set for each receiver. The complete alignment 
                of an HRO Sr. required about four hours. With the HRO Jr. the 
                coils were aligned to an average receiver and the receivers were 
                aligned with an average coil set so that one did not have the 
                precision alignment that was obtained with the more expensive 
                receiver.<br>
                <br>
                In August 1936, Millen announced a new receiver designed for both 
                amateurs and short-wave listeners, the NC-100X. This basic design 
                would be carried through in many more receiver designs, the 100XA, 
                the NC-101 series, the NC-200 family that came out just before 
                WWII, to mention a few. Unfortunately, time and space do not permit 
                a detailed examination of these and many other receivers that 
                National engineers developed. Suffice to say, that by the middle 
                1930's the design of high performance receivers had advanced from 
                an art to a science and National built up a very competent engineering 
                staff that kept National products up to date and in high demand.

                In 1939 lightning struck! The June 1939 issue of QST carried an 
                announcement that as of May first, 1939, James Millen had &quot;completely 
                withdrawn from the National Company......&quot; What had happened 
                to end such a successful collaboration of almost 15 years?<br>
                <br>
                The immediate reason occurred early in 1939. According to Millen, 
                Warren Hopkins, who held the controlling interest in National, 
                told Millen that he (Hopkins) wanted Millen to switch the emphasis 
                of the company from making short-wave radios for a very limited 
                sector of the country to making broadcast type radios to be marketed 
                by the retail giants as Sears Roebuck, Montgomery Ward and the 
                many large and well known department stores around the country. 
                The purpose of the drastic change was to make the National Company 
                a &quot;household name&quot; in the radio business.<br>
                <br>
                Millen was flabbergasted!<br>
                <br>
                National had been highly successful in designing and manufacturing 
                short-wave radios; in fact, they were the recognized leader in 
                the receiver field and more recently in transmitter and accessory 
                items, too. Equally important, the company was profitable!<br>
                <br>
                Why? Hopkins would give no definite reasons, saying only that 
                he wanted to change the direction of the company, and the company 
                needed products where it would have more exposure.<br>
                <br>
                Millen wanted no part of it; he was dedicated to building the 
                best receivers that he could build regardless of price. The consumer 
                radio business was completely alien to him. So he left National 
                and formed his own business.<br>
                <br>
                From a historical point of view it is interesting to pause a moment 
                and look back and examine what Millen had contributed to the National 
                Company, Inc. in it transformation from a toy maker to a leadership 
                role in short-wave communications receivers.<br>
                <br>
                First, I have heard it said by people who were closely associated 
                with National, but not employed by National, that, in the 1930's 
                National was run by Jim Millen and his secretary Frances Bearse. 
                Miss Bearse held the formal title of Office Manager but was apparently 
                more of Millen's right-hand &quot;man.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Second, Millen traveled extensively in those days visiting suppliers, 
                dealers and most important, individual amateurs and amateurs radio 
                clubs throughout the country. When he returned to Malden, he knew 
                what new materials and components were available. He would sit 
                down with his designers and sketch out new products. In short, 
                Millen was an &quot;idea man.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                The third role Millen played was as a publicist. As noted earlier, 
                Millen had a flair for writing and he used this ability well. 
                He usually wrote a magazine article describing each new product, 
                but more than that, he would explain in simple technical terms 
                why it was built the way it was. By the end of the article most 
                readers would agree that the way National designed the equipment 
                was the &quot;only way&quot; to do it and nobody could improve 
                upon it.<br>
                <br>
                In the march 1934 issue of QST Millen inaugurated what is probably 
                the longest running and most successful series of technical advertisments. 
                These were always the first advertising page in QST and consisted 
                of a single page write-up on some technical topic of interest 
                at the time: a description of a new receiver, a new circuit or 
                component of something similar. This page was known as &quot;page 
                73&quot; at National regardless of the magazine page on which 
                it was printed. This series continued through number 243 which 
                appeared in the July 1954 QST, a run of over 20 years.<br>
                <br>
                In retrospect, Millen believes Warren Hopkins' desire to change 
                direction was based on another consideration; Hopkins died of 
                cancer in the early 1940's and Millen feels that Hopkins was told 
                he had cancer in early 1939 and had only a few years to live. 
                Hopkins wanted to convert his assets into the maximum amount of 
                cash possible. This would be a natural reaction for any business 
                man in Hopkins' situation. National had a good reputation in amateur 
                and Government circles but was virtually unknown by the general 
                public or, equally important, by the financial community which 
                would ultimately set the value of his holdings. This lack of recognization 
                would tend to hold down the price of National stock.<br>
                <br>
                As it turned out, Hopkins got his wish of increased value for 
                his stock but from an entirely different direction.<br>
                <br>
                In the summer of 1939 war broke out in Europe; representatives 
                of Allied governments, particularly the Royal Navy, visited National 
                and ordered large numbers of receivers, particularly HRO's. When 
                the United States entered the war some two years later, the word 
                was &quot;Start building HROs; we'll tell you when to stop.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Needless to say, National began producing for the war effort. 
                The number of employees went from the 200-300 range to about 2500 
                during the war. The war effort brought increased recognition and 
                profits to National and after the war, in the late forties, National 
                went public.</font>

                an impressive array of military, industrial, and consumer as well 
                as amateur products and appeared to have a very promising future.<br>
                <br>
                Effective June 1, 1953 William A. Ready retired, after almost 
                forty years as president of National, and Charles C. Hornbostel 
                became president. Hornbostel graduated from the Harvard School 
                of Business specializing in accounting.<br>
                <br>
                William A. Ready is remembered as a kindly person by his fellow 
                employees at National. He knew most employees on a first name 
                basis as well as their wife's and children's names. He was always 
                available and often stopped to talk with employees on his tours 
                through the plant. No special introductions were needed.<br>
                <br>
                Ready began the tradition of holding employee Christmas parties. 
                Former National employees still gather at Christmas to renew old 
                friendships and memories. I have been priviledged to attend several 
                of these reunions and have found the employees treasure their 
                memories there. National must have been an interesting place to 
                work!<br>
                <br>
                After the company went public, a controlling interest was acquired 
                by Louis C. Learner, an investment company, and the Learner interests 
                took control. Legal technicalities tend to obscure the facts and 
                I have not been able to dtermine all the details to my satisfaction.<br>
                <br>
                The new management apparently set up a second company called National 
                Radio Company, Inc.; all Government work continued to be charged 
                to the National Company, but now all commercial and amateur work 
                was charged to the National Radio Company. Press releases were 
                made detailing plans for rejuvination of the company and the price 
                of the stock went up. At that point the Learner interests sold 
                their stock. Several component productlines were sold to Japanese 
                interests as was the production machinery and the name National 
                Company, Inc. The National Radio Company went into bankruptcy 
                and that name was sold to the bankrupt's principal creditor, who 
                in turn sold it to the FAN-WEL Corp., who purchased the remaining 
                assets as well. In June 1974, FAN-WEL changed its name to National 
                Radio Company, Inc. and is still doing business under that name.<br>
                <br>
                The Japanese-held National Company, Inc. makes consumer type radios 
                but, to the best of my knowledge, they are not sold in this country. 
                Warren Hopkins had his wish come true after all.</font>

                group; particularly Vincent and Edith Messina, Conrad Espinola, 
                Jack Ivers and Gene Simms. It has been a real pleasure meeting 
                these people. I would like to also thank the management and employees 
                of the present National Radio Company for letting me browse through 
                their files of the old Nation Company.<br>
                <br>
                Last, but certainly not least, my wife Martha has spent a lot 
                of time correcting and revising my manuscripts and turned it into 
                something readable.<br>
                <br>
                I can not conceive that this document is free of errors, although 
                it is based on the best evidence available to me. I will be happy 
                to hear from anyone having more accurate information.</font></td>
