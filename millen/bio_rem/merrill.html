                above is that of Merrill W. Bancroft standing beside his excellent 
                display of James Millen memorabilia at the 2001 Antique Wireless 
                Association conference in Rochester, NY. It was a matter of only 
                a few months after Millen's death that his estate was offered 
                for auction. Much of Millen's property, including his original 
                1936 station had already been donated to the AWA before his death 
                (see elsewhere on this website for details.) This display won 
                &quot;The Display Award &quot; and finished first in the Vacuum 
                Tube Transmitters and Receivers display category.</font>
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How 
                did Merrill find all these Millen items? In his own words, &quot;I 
                live in Townsend, Ma.My most significant collecting experience 
                and luckiest day was the day of the auction at Jim's estate at 
                the end of Tarbox Lane, his private road in North Reading, Ma. 
                Three factors contributed to this day for me. First there was 
                a meet at the Rhode Island Wireless and Steam Museum that day 
                and second, the temperature was a record 98 degrees. Third, John 
                Nagle had an auto breakdown on the way up from Herndon, Va. and 
                never made it. The end result was that there was nobody interested 
                in the stuff but me. I also should mention that that Sunday for 
                some reason, and the first time ever, I picked up a copy of the 
                Boston Globe and saw the notice of Jims estate auction. I'm sure 
                it was well known that Jim had a very complete collection of radio 
                periodicals. Well the first lot that went up included a complete 
                set of QST's in binders with perhaps 50 extra pre 1920 issues. 
                I started off the bidding at $25 dollars and that is also where 
                it ended! Suffice to say this trend continued through the entire 
                magazine auction to the extent that I had seven pickup loads of 
                bound material and other paper to take home. I hate to think what 
                would have happened to this stuff, especially the personal items 
                such as the ME degree if I hadn't gone because no one else was 
                interested in any of it. I had two regrets. All of the QSL cards 
                that Jim had around the upper walls of his ham shack (which were 
                shown in the CQ article) were probably destroyed because I couldn't 
                take the time to get them down. The other was the DFP receiver 
                prototypes some of were offered to me but I had no room for. Remember 
                that I had a huge pile of material to get home in an open pickup 
                and it was clouding up and it did rain just after I unloaded the 
                last load.&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Merrill's 
                story is not uncommon and would be a dream come true for many 
                collectors. At the AWA conference Merrill did mention that someday 
                all this material will be donated to the AWA museum so that it 
                can live on for future generations of radio collectors and Millen 
                enthusiasts. It is a shame that some items may have found the 
                end of existance, including those rare DFP receiver prototypes. 
                But perhaps even those were saved and will resurface again someday.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Returning 
                to the display. The large framed item in the center is Millen's 
                original Mechanical Engineering diploma from the Stevens Institute 
                of Technology. Among the paperwork are original letters to and 
                from Millen and Clarence D. Tuska relating to the patent on the 
                famous National PW dial drive assembly, often refered to as the 
                HRO dial. For those Millen collectors is his original resignation 
                letter to the National Company and their return letter of acceptance. 
                Both dated April 17, 1939.</font></p>
