              <p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The story of Jim Millen, his work 
                with National and later his own company, has been covered before 
                (CQ, July 1967, pp.26-31) but it would take a dozen such articles 
                to do justice to the subject.<br>
                <br>
                In 13 years he transformed the old National Toy Company into the 
                country's foremost ham and commercial radio manufacturer, but 
                when National's backers tried to freeze Jim out of the profits 
                (by paying themselves high salaries to reduce profits to be split) 
                he knew it was time to form his own company. To guard against 
                similar problems in the future, he became a banker himself, and 
                indeed is still active in that profession.<br>
                <br>
                It was a good time to be in electronics; the industry was small 
                enough so that many engineers and executives knew each other personally. 
                As an illustration of how the industry was run, among those who 
                played the game like sportsmen, Jim tells of a request from RCA 
                for his company to build their service oscilloscopes.<br>
                <br>
                He needed a $100,000 loan to set up production lines, which was 
                out of the question through formal channels. But RCA arranged 
                to sell CRT's to Millen who would install them in the scopes and 
                sell them back to RCA at the same price. Millen's invoice to RCA 
                was paid within ten days, but RCA allowed six months to pay their 
                invoices. Result: a $100,000 interest free loan!<br>
                <br>
                Similar arrangements could be made for an RCA license, which 'formally' 
                cost $100,000, far too much for a small company to pay. But Millen 
                could license RCA to use some of his lesser patents for $90,000, 
                and pay them their $100,000, in effect getting the license for 
                $10,000.<br>
                <br>
                In May 1938, QST carried a notice of the new James Millen Company, 
                and in October their first ad and catalog appeared. Succeeding 
                catalogs featured a rapidly-expanding line of mechanical components, 
                all soundly engineered - some have survived unchanged for forty 
                years - but this was just the tip of the iceberg.<br>
                <br>
                What really paid the company bills was the subcontracting work 
                for firms such as RCA and GE. They found it far cheaper to have 
                Millen make equipment than to set up their own production lines. 
                It might be service scopes for RCA, two-way police radios for 
                GE, wartime gear for MIT's Radiation Lab, or marine radar for 
                Raytheon.<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes the products were fully engineered and ready for production; 
                more often Millen would receive an electrical prototype and would 
                do all the mechanical design themselves. As new components were 
                designed and tooled up, they would appear in the catalog. Subcontract 
                work accounted for perhaps three-quarters of Millen's total output, 
                and kept the amateur activities afloat.<br>
                <br>
                Millen's approach to ham equipment was to take electrical designs 
                originated by others, and to adapt them mechanically for commercial 
                production. Their first venture was a tunable heterodyne filter, 
                used in the headphone line outboard of a receiver, adapted from 
                a September 1939 QST article and made under license (given gratis) 
                by its author Dr. Ray Woodward. In January 1941 QST published 
                a description of Henry Rice's clever VFO called the &quot;Variarm&quot;, 
                and shortly Millen had a commercial model going.<br>
                <br>
                Jim Millen had intended from the beginning, to make an amateur 
                receiver, but not until the war's end was he in the position to 
                do so. He had an elaborate design ready, a receiver incorporating 
                every feature a ham could want: direct frequency readout, ten 
                ham- and general-coverage bands, motor-assisted tuning, motor-driven 
                bandswitching, etc etc.<br>
                <br>
                It appeared in the early 1947 catalog, as a &quot;custom-built&quot; 
                model, but it must have been apparent, some time before, that 
                it was not a profitable venture: no ham could afford it. Only 
                one prototype was ever finished.<br>
                <br>
                A &quot;cheaper&quot; model was under design at the same time, 
                using a more traditional approach, with sliding coil catacomb 
                (like the Millen-designed pre-war National models) and band-set-bandspread 
                tuning condensors. This model DFP-201 is absolutely typical of 
                Millen's design philosophy, that a sound mechanical design was 
                the foundation on which the electrical design would be built.<br>
                <br>
                Millen unveiled the DFP201 (and the 501) at a Chicago trade show 
                in May 1947, and put it in his catalog, but it was soon obvious 
                that even this &quot;cheaper&quot; model could never be sold; 
                their no-compromise design philosophy made it far to expensive. 
                The few prototypes that were completed were said to have cost 
                $2100 apiece to build. Both models were immediately withdrawn, 
                and revised catalogs printed.<br>
                <br>
                Through the 1950's and 60's new ham equipment appeared in Millen 
                catalogs, side by side with mechanical components.<br>
                <br>
                After 38 years it was time to pull the plug. Their antiquated 
                factory building was in the path of urban renewal, and massive 
                renovations would have been needed to meet new OSHA safety regulations. 
                Jim suffered a heart attack and had to reduce his activities, 
                so in May 1977 the factory was closed. Jim retired to his farm 
                and his banking interests. He feels lucky to have been in the 
                electronics business when there was room for individual effort, 
                and certainly the rest of us are lucky to have benefitted from 
                his contributions.<br>
                <br>
                My thanks to (naturally) Jim Millen, his production superintendent 
                Gene Williams and 30-year employee Mel Dunbrack, and to Tom Rutherford 
                who salvaged from the factory much of the equipment that otherwise 
                would have been scrapped.</font></td>
