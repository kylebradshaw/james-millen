                <Font Color="Blue">Anthony (Tony) Alegero started at James Millen 
                Manufacturing in 1949 as an assistant foreman in the production 
                of variable capacitors. Later he moved on to become foreman of 
                the coil winding and distributed delay line department. Tony provides 
                a great deal of insight into the working of the Millen operations 
                during the years when employment was at some of the largest numbers 
                in the companies history.<Br>

                I was green out of eighteen months of <a href="http://electricalengineering.online.njit.edu/">electronics 
                school</a> in the USN and looking for a job. Born, schooled and 
                still living in Malden made Millen a good spot to start jobhunting. 
                I applied and was interviewed by Phil Eyrick and hired to be asssistant 
                foreman of the Variable Capacitor department. working under Ray 
                Fittz. He was an ME Tufts grad who had worked during the war at 
                RCA in NJ. Helluva nice guy to work for and a great mentor. When 
                I read of OSHA and EPA these days I often think of working with 
                cyanide to remove silver plate tarnish, the girls (today ladies) 
                were busy all day scrubbing all the ceramic parts of finished 
                caps with of all things carbon tetrachloride. Somewhere in the 
                early fifties someone became aware of what CCL4 could do to your 
                kidneys so we padlocked the 55 gal drum spigots and only the supervisors 
                could dispense it. We also had vent hoods built in our own sheet 
                metal shop for the girls to work under. These simply discharged 
                out the adjacent windows. Most of our shaft couplings and terminal 
                strips were manufactured in this same department.<Br>
                <Br>
                Phil Eyrick was production manager over the whole plant during 
                my whole stay. After a couple of years they moved Howard Stone 
                from coil winding foreman to final assembly and I took over the 
                coil winding and distributed delay line winding depts. There I 
                had anywhere from 10-12 girls winding rf chokes, IF xfmrs, large 
                xmitter tank coils and coil forms (ceramic and plastic). In an 
                adjacent elevated gallery we had the distributed delay winding 
                machine run by one woman. This consisted of roughly 3/8 saran 
                tubing in up to 100 foot lengths which was continuously wound 
                with from about #36 to #40 formex insulated wire. This in turn 
                was continuously wrapped with a very thin teflon tape which in 
                turn was covered with a copper braid shield. It was unique because 
                the long lengths were then chopped off at so many microseconds 
                delay per foot depending on the customers need. My memory sugggests 
                this process was developed by GE and licensed to Millen but I 
                may be wrong.<Br>

                In the early fifties Bob Pearson, ME Iowa State, came aboard and 
                was originally Ray Fittz's right hand man. He, Dick Evans and 
                I became sort of a triumvirate on and off the job as we were all 
                in our marrying days and were part of each others wedding parties. 
                Bob was a real nautical man and collectively owned about four 
                boats. We on occasion would all head for the boat after work, 
                including another name that just occurred to me, George Pike. 
                George was the company purchasing agent and did all the company 
                buying. We thought nothing of heading from Lynn MA to Marblehead 
                at 6 pm and returning by 12. Eventually both Bob Pierson and Ray 
                Fittz left to go to Towle Silversmiths as ME's.<Br>

                All through my days Gene Williams was Millen Sales Manager. And 
                of course, as in so many companys the real force behind the company 
                was &quot;Miss&quot; Bearse.<Br>
                <Br>
                CRT shields was a very profitable business at the time, as a considerable 
                amount of work on radar development was going on. These were made 
                of a high permeability alloy called Mumetal. If the design required 
                spinning (a shaping process) to achieve a certain shape or size 
                this was done by a couple of companies in the Malden, Everett, 
                MA area. They were then painted, labelled, etc. The metal also 
                required annealing after any drilling, punching, etc. This also 
                represented a good source of business for several Greater Boston 
                heat treating firms. The sizes we made kept growing as available 
                CRT sizes increased. Mu metal was tough to work with as it was 
                a pretty hard metal that came in about 4X12 foot sheets and was 
                pretty thin. It could and did inflict some pretty rough cuts on 
                workers. According to other article on the JMS website it sounds 
                as though the business was bought by one of the original spinning 
                companies.<Br>
                <Br>
                The Paint department was run by Frank Weaver. He was able to spray 
                paint almost anything to some pretty tight specs, including a 
                few government jobs of my own. A lot of the delay line assemblies 
                were hermetically canned and thus were painted, all CRT shields 
                were painted as well as the classic black wrinkle that you have 
                all seen as the classic Millen finish.<Br>
                <Br>
                The Sheet Metal department was run by I believe Bob Carlson. They 
                made all chassis, housings, CRT shields, cases for delay line 
                cans, etc. A well run group with capable people.<Br>
                <Br>
                Dick Evans was responsible for the Machine Shop, at least part 
                of my time of employment. Can't think of any of the others. There 
                was one, to me at the time, elderly gentleman whose name escapes 
                me who was the super machinist, whose job was to make the molds 
                for injection molding. The Injection Molding department was run, 
                I think, by Frank Weaver when he wasn't spraypainting. These were 
                jobs that weren't full time. All those polystyrene coil forms 
                that were turned out by the thousands for GDO coils were made 
                on a pretty good sized injection mold press. Another interesting 
                note on the subject of plastics, the poly strips that many tank 
                coils were mounted on were cut by bandsaw from large sheets. In 
                order to get rid of the saw marks on the edges after manufacture 
                we dipped the whole coils in vapor degreasers with TCE which took 
                out the marks and gave them a polished edge.<Br>

                Jim Millen was in the plant most days. He was a very quiet man 
                and seemed a little aloof to us peasants. He very commonly closed 
                his door after lunch and took a nap on the leather couch in his 
                office carefully guarded by &quot;Miss&quot; Bearse. There weren't 
                many who called him &quot;Jim&quot;. In later years, I often wondered 
                whether he wasn't actually a shy man. He would often make his 
                way around the departments observing but saying nothing. You would 
                hear later from Phil Eyrick about his observations. I would disagree, 
                at least during my stay, about no smoking. There were breaks where 
                you could go outside in the shipping area or out on a deck outside 
                the machine shop on the roof for a &quot;butt&quot;. Also, there 
                were always a few who would grab a smoke in the mens room where 
                the window was always wide open. Once in a while Phil Eyrick would 
                come in, and out the window would go all the butts. Speaking of 
                &quot;out the window&quot;, the back of the factory overhung the 
                Malden Brook. All the plants back windows were over the brook. 
                When there were too many rejects they were known to have landed 
                in the brook. Thank God for no EPA in those days.<Br>

                Enough for now.<Br>
