                In May of 1977, the James Millen Manufacturing Company, as many 
                of us have known it, closed their doors. However, what many people 
                do not realize is that Millen manufacturing went on. In a release<a href="3cletter.html" name="Millen Letter"> 
                letter </a>from James Millen he states &quot;Now it is time to 
                slow down and let my younger colleagues carry on.&quot; The James 
                Millen Company was sold off into three separate organizations. 
                At the time they were Caywood Electronics, Inc., MuShield Company, 
                and Electronic Instruments &amp; Specility Corp. You will notice 
                that none of the companies retained the Millen name. This was 
                done at the directive of Mr. Millen and he originally retained 
                the rights to the Millen name. As you will read below this eventually 
                changed and two of the three companies again use the Millen name 
                in their titles.<br>
                <br>
                Caywood Electronics, Inc., was started by Mr. R. Wade Caywood 
                who was at one time a Chief Engineer at Millen and later Vice 
                President and General Manager. Caywood had been an employee of 
                the James Millen Company since around 1941, very near the beginning. 
                If you view some of the schematics here on the Millen Page you 
                will notice Mr. Caywoods initials (R.W.C.) on most of them. In 
                1987 Caywood was bought out by Ralph Jannini, KA1FAA, and added 
                the name <a href="http://www.jamesmillenco.com/millen/millmain.htm" target="_blank">James 
                Millen Electronics</a>, A division of Caywood Electronics, Inc. 
                The company is located in Andover, Massachusetts. In the Millen 
                tradition, James Millen Electronics manufactures many of the original 
                components, such as air variable capacitors, high voltage switches, 
                ceramic insulators, etc. Almost any of the Millen components would 
                and could be manufactured by Millen Electronics provided that 
                the demand were high enough to warrant production setup. In addition, 
                much of the electronic equipment is actively being produced, including 
                such items as transmatches, oscilloscopes and the grid-dip meters. 
                The later are still widely used in the paper industry. Current 
                prices on their solid-state dippers have essentially placed them 
                out of the reach of most hobbyists pocketbooks though. Also in 
                production are precision cable delay lines used by the government. 
                When Ralph purchased Caywood he also renewed the Millen name and 
                trademark and has advertised in the Amateur Radio Mail Order Catalog 
                and Resource Directory published by the American Radio Relay Leaque 
                (ARRL). In addition to his Millen work Ralph operates the Unadilla 
                Antenna Manufacturing Company and Andover Books. Unadilla produces 
                and distributes antenna baluns, traps, insulators and coaxial 
                relays.<br>
                <br>
                Mr. Jannini is a native of the Malden Massachusetts area and grew 
                up near the original Millen plant. He has fond memories of stopping 
                by the plant for assistance with such &quot;technical&quot; requirements 
                as getting the flat tire fixed on his bicycle!<br>
                <br>
                A second company to come out of the 1977 division was Electronic 
                Instruments &amp; Specialty Corporation (EIS). EIS created a division 
                called the MC Division. Although there was no indication for the 
                letters MC, perhaps because James Millen still retained the Millen 
                name rights, it is obviously an abbreviation for &quot;Millen 
                Components&quot;. I could only find limited advertisments for 
                this Millen breakoff company, one being a small ad in the November 
                1981 QST magazine. With former factory manager, Alvar Melin and 
                office and order control manager, Angelo Caputo retaining their 
                past positions, the new company was formed under the new president 
                Robert Painter. Under Mr. Painter's direction the name had been 
                changed to <a href="http://www.jamesmillen.com" name="Millen Manufacturing Division" target="_blank">Millen 
                Manufacturing Division</a> (Millen Hardware on their webpage) 
                of Beta Labs, Inc. Beta Labs is located in Stoneham, Massachusetts. 
                This division primarily manufactures some of the original Millen 
                hardware, such as the high voltage connectors, shaft couplings, 
                shaft locks, ceramic sockets, right angle drives and counter dials. 
                The Millen Hardware Division was sold by Mr. Painter in December 
                of 1999 to Custom Metal Products Inc., Melrose, Massachusetts. 
                Now owned by former engineer/employee; Mr. Jacob Burke and Mr. 
                Francis Gardner. Custom Metal Products had been manufacturing 
                parts for Mr. Painter in their state of the art manufacturing 
                facility for some time and with the purchase of Millen Hardware 
                have taken over all manufacturing and assembly. In a quote from 
                Mr. Gardner, &quot;The change in ownership has not only signaled 
                a new life into the product line it has also moved Millen back 
                toward its roots. Located in an old mill building near the Malden 
                Ma. line our home was once the home of National Radio.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                The last of the three companies, and the only one to no longer 
                use any reference to the Millen name, is <a href="http://www.mushield.com" name="MuShield Company" target="_blank">The 
                MuShield Company., Inc.</a> MuShield was originally managed by 
                Mr. Owen (hap) Haszard, who was the former Millen shield specialist 
                in Malden, Massachusetts as part of the New England Metal Spinning 
                Company. MuShield moved to Goffstown, New Hampshire in 1989 and 
                is currently operated by Mr. David Grilli as a privately held 
                company. The MuShield found extensive use in early Millen oscilloscopes. 
                The current manufacturer carries on this product tradition by 
                providing magnetic shielding and monitor enclosures designed to 
                eliminate interference caused by EMI.<br>
                <br>
                It is understandable how the Millen demise could have propagated. 
                The separation into three companies from a vertical manufacturing 
                company such as the James Millen Manufacturing must have been 
                an interesting process to manage for the initial owners. Although 
                not one of the three separate companies would be considered large 
                in comparison to todays multinational electronic manufacturing 
                conglomerates, they have all survived! MuShield appears to be 
                the most successful with estimates of up to $2.5m in annual sales. 
                This is probably due to their modernization and adaptation into 
                new areas of use for the magnetic shielding products produced. 
                For James Millen Electronics and Beta Labs it is through the demand 
                that exists for original James Millen designs that remain timeless, 
                which needless to say has placed them in a rather niche market. 
                I am personally indebted to these companies and wish them continued 
                success as they carry on the tradition of the James Millen Manufacturing 
                Company.<br>
                <br>
                I thankfully acknowledge the kind assistance of Mr. Ralph Jannini 
                for his input and review of the material in this paper. Our frank 
                and open conversations about the Millen-after-Millen companies 
                has been instrumental in clarifying how the Millen namesake organizations 
                operate today.<br>
