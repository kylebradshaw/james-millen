                is a story behind those unchanging Millen ads that appear year 
                after year in CQ. It is the story of a man who pioneered in the 
                state of the art many of the things that we now take for granted, 
                for r.f.chokes, coil forms, variable capacitors, and the famous 
                Millen dials all owe at least part of their existence to his influence. 
                James Millen fathered the concept of superior mechanical, as well 
                as electrical design that has become a standard in the electronics

                it can strike at any time or stage in a man's life. It hit Jim 
                Millen while he was attending high school in Forest Hills, Long 
                Island. The fascination of communication by wireless... By 1916 
                Jim has a station on the air.<br>
                <br>
                In those days ham radio was a bit different. You took a spark 
                coil from a Ford motorcar and souped it up by adding larger contacts 
                so it could handle the 110 volt d.c. house current instead of 
                the 6 volts for which the coil was designed. This coil then excited 
                a helix coil affair which was tuned by a large home made capacitor. 
                The Q was very low and the resultant signal was quite broad, being 
                somewhere around the upper part of the present broadcast band. 
                This spark signal was received with either a galena or electrolytic 
                type of detector and a set of headphones, and sounded like a raspy 
                buzzy note that wasn't the most pleasant sort of thing. Those 
                who wanted to improve the sound of the transmitted signal used 
                a rotary spark-gap , imparting a high audio frequency whine which 
                acted to modulate the transmitted signal. This was the state of 
                the art before the First World War.<br>
                <br>
                After the war to end all wars was over, and the world went back 
                to what it was doing before, amateur radio operators went back 
                to experimenting with several new pieces of apparatus developed 
                for the war effort. The most noted was the tube called the J-type 
                manufactured by the Western Electric Company and it found widespread 
                use in both transmitting and receiving modes. It replaced the 
                spark transmitter when used as a keyed triode oscillator, and 
                as a gridleak detector proved superior to the crystal set. Jim 
                was among those experimenting and learning on the ham bands around 
                200 meters.<br>
                <br>
                Herbert Hoover Sr., 6DH personally signed all licenses issued 
                by the Department of Commerce and Jim Millen was given the call 
                2BYP in 1921.<br>
                <br>
                Upon graduation from high school Jim studied mechanical engineering 
                (there being no formal course of study in electronics at the time) 
                at Stevens Institute. During the 4 year course of study, 1922-1926, 
                Jim Millen started making receivers as his first commercial enterprise 
                and the October 1922 issue of <i>Radio News Magazine</i> carried 
                the original Millen Advertisement.<br>
                <br>
                Other magazines also started carrying the Millen name, first with 
                pen and ink drawings of radio diagrams, then a question and answer 
                column, and finally Jim ended up writing a monthly technical article. 
                Starting as a means to help pay tuition, writing was to become 
                a very important part of a fascinating career.<br>
                <br>
                The 4 years spent at Stevens earning the M.E. degree were interesting 
                ones as many of the pioneers of the electronics field either taught, 
                or were classmates of Jim's. Dr. Alan Hazeltine, the designer 
                of the Nuetrodyne circuit; Paul Ware, founder of Ware Radio; and 
                Larry Horle, of Federal Radio were on the staff and Ted Smith, 
                later of RCA, was a fellow student.<br>
                <br>
                Upon graduation from Stevens, Jim worked on the editorial staff 
                of <i>Radio Broadcast Magazine</i>, published by the Doubleday-Page 
                Company. Contributions were also made to the other radio magazines.<br>
                <br>
                James Millen then decided to put his experience to use in consulting 
                work and a company was formed. Working closely with companies 
                that were to become famous in the electronics field, clients included 
                the American Appliance Company (called Raytheon a year later), 
                the Ceco Tube Company of Providence, R.I. and the National Toy 
                Company. RKO Studios also became a customer when they came to 
                New York to make their first two &quot;Talking Pictures.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                During this period of time Arthur Lynch took over the management 
                of radio WRNY and <i>Radio News Magazine</i>. He also had started 
                a resistor manufacturing company developing among other things 
                a solid-state diode long before current solid-state technology. 
                Millen worked with him while attending Stevens, and continued 
                while doing consulting.<br>
                <br>
                One of Jim's clients, the National Toy Company, was attempting 
                to break into the &quot;new&quot; radio industry and made a deal 
                with him to put them in the field. In 1928 Jim took over operation 
                of National and entered a very fascinating part of his career.

                </center>
              <p align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The First step was to have National 
                enter the amateur receiver market. Combining his mechanical engineering 
                background with electronic experience gained through operating 
                and experimenting, Jim produced the first of a long list of good 
                receivers. The model was called the SW-5 and it met with immediate 
                success, as it enabled the shortwave listener or ham to have a 
                good factory wired receiver at a resonable cost.<br>
                <br>
                The SW-5 was originally a battery powered unit and required husky 
                batteries for the filament supply, so research was done to see 
                if it would be feasible to run a shortwave radio from the power 
                lines. The problems encountered seemed insurmountable at first; 
                for a.c. on the filaments of the tubes caused a hum in the loadspeaker, 
                and instability at the higher frequencies. Better tubes and a 
                lot of research time in the laboratory overcame the hum problems 
                finally and the shortwave listener could eliminate the bulky storage 
                battery. Trying to rectify the power line voltage to provide d.c. 
                voltage for the plate supply was the next step, and problems were 
                met here also because the c.w. signal from the receiver had an 
                annoying ripple until power supply filtering techniques were perfected.<br>
                <br>
                Jim and his group seemed to thrive on challenges. After a model 
                was built they looked for ways to make it better, less expensive, 
                or more universal. After the SW-5 came the SW-3. It was more compact, 
                lighter (suggested use in aircraft) and required less current 
                from batteries. The SW-4 and FB-7 evolved next, then the classic 
                National HRO was developed followed by the NC-100, NC-200, etc. 
                Men that helped in the design of these receivers included Dave 
                Grimes, R.S. Kruse, and Zeh Bouck.<br>
                <br>
                Going north along Route One from Boston brings one to Malden, 
                Massachusetts, the home of the National Radio Company. The Millen 
                home, located nearby, proved a natural for testing new designs, 
                antennas, or frequencies. The location also had other advantages. 
                This writer found it peaceful and beautifully scenic - just the 
                place to experiment and operate, or write.<br>
                <br>
                QST at that time was being run by Ross Hull, and he and K.B. Warner, 
                the League's manager, were close friends to Jim Millen. The close 
                cooperation of these men made possible the sharing of new developments 
                with the amateur fraternity almost on a monthly basis, as much 
                of the experimenting and editorial work for QST was done at the 
                Millen shack.<br>
                <br>
                <i>The Radio Amateur's Handbook </i>as we know it today also came 
                about through the Millen-QST relationship. In the early 30's it 
                was a pamphlet-sized affair until Jim underwrote the cost of a 
                larger and more complete book. National Radio, under Millen, became 
                the first advertiser.<br>
                <br>
                This period of time also brought about some historical v.h.f. 
                work. Under the leadership of Ross Hull, Jim Millen participated 
                as the Boston station of a triangular setup with each leg consisting 
                of a 100 mile path. Recorders were set up to measure the reliability 
                of the nightly transmissions on the 5-meter band. The favorable 
                results of the experiment paved the way for the later allocated 
                2 and 6 meter bands. Ross Hull was killed in an accident before 
                he was able to compile all the data, but he did give several talks 
                before scientific societies in Washington. The equipment used 
                consisted of push-pull 800's running over a hundred watts and 
                feeding a large 8-element array at each station. The receivers 
                used were of National manufacture and were superregenerative.<br>
                <br>
                Other &quot;Firsts&quot; during Jim's stay at National included 
                the backing of Jim Lamb on his single signal crystal filter work, 
                the use of Red Cross TB stamps affixed to a National ad in QST 
                as a charity gesture, and the initiation of the monthly series 
                of &quot;Personal Message&quot; type of advertisments starting 
                with the March 1934 issue of QST. This form of advertising is 
                still being carried on by others.<br>
                <br>
                Perhaps one of the most important contributions to the state of 
                the art occurred in 1934 when the present design of the r.f. choke 
                was developed. Prior to that time chokes were wound on high value 
                resistors or wooden sticks, much the same way we do now if an 
                experimental choke is needed. Many chokes were made and tested 
                to determine hot spots and frequency range, and finally a predictable 
                and mechanical sound choke came about, Jim was issued a patent 
                on October 2, 1934, and the 2.5mhy choke quickly became a standard 
                throughout the industry.<br>
                <br>
                James Millen also continued his writing and many of the designs 
                of the National Company were shared with hams through magazine 
                articles and a number of books including <i>Radio Design Practice, 
                </i>and an excellent v.h.f. text, called <i>Below Ten Meters</i>. 
                Numerous pamphlets were also printed so that amateurs could duplicate 
                National's designs.<br>
                <br>
                The newly developed air transportation services discovered that 
                ham radio equipment worked well for ground to air communication 
                and in the late 20's and early 30's became a large, but little 
                known customer of the National Company. National was doing well.<br>
                <br>
                In 1939 the National Radio Company went &quot;Public&quot;. During 
                the same year James Millen made a friendly withdrawal from the 
                company, and along with several associates started the James Millen 
                Manufacturing Company. An announcement of the newly formed company 
                was run in the May, 1939 QST.<br>
                <br>
                Jim had started the policy early in his career of working with 
                the very best talent possible and made no exception when the manufacturing 
                company was started. John Di Blasi, 2FX, and Charlie Cooper, both 
                well known men in their fields, were among those that Jim brought 
                with him.<br>
                <br>
                John, 2FX, is perhaps best known to readers of <i>CQ</i> as the 
                founder and president of the Quarter Century Wireless Association. 
                He is also the New York representative of Millen Manufacturing.<br>
                <br>
                The late Charlie Cooper had also an interesting life. He was an 
                early associate of DeForest, and later founded the Ship Owner's 
                Radio Service. The latter provided wireless for boats and eventually 
                became part of RCA. Charlie was also a poet and often delighted 
                the company with verse.<br>
                <br>
                The summer of '39 was an active one as many items of manufacture 
                were reviewed by Millen and his associates to see what improvements 
                could be made. Tools were designed and made, and a factory was 
                leased in the fall. A catalog was then released and James Millen 
                was in business.<br>
                <br>
                The importance of good mechanical design in the manufacture of 
                electronic components was always stressed during Jim's career. 
                At National Radio, a good example of this approach could be found 
                in the HRO receiver. Here, the main emphasis was placed on the 
                tuning capacitor and dial combination. The time was well spent 
                as the receiver met with great success. The practice of good mechanical 
                and electrical design was carried over to the Millen Company and 
                the company slogan &quot;Designed For Application&quot; became 
                well earned.<br>
                <br>
                Although the Millen factory originally started making components, 
                they soon began the manufacture of electronic equipment. Oscilloscopes 
                were built for RCA, and the first commercial two-way f.m. radio 
                equipment was designed and built for G.E.<br>
                <br>
                Looking for ways of combining electronic with mechnical design 
                has brought James Millen to many places throughout the world. 
                Trips to Europe enabled the American manufacture of items such 
                as coil forms, tube sockets, sheets and tubing made with polystyrene 
                and other low loss injection moldable plastics shortly after their 
                European discovery.<br>
                <br>
                Another important type of component developed at Millen was the 
                magnetic metal shield. Using commercially available ingots of 
                Mu Metal made in Trenton, New Jersey by the Henry Porter laboratory, 
                the Millen people pioneered in the manufacture of custom and stock 
                magnetic shielding for cathode ray tubes, photo multipliers, and

                During the Second World War the Millen Company worked with G.E. 
                to produce the &quot;continuous&quot; type of delay cable and 
                the neccessary machinery for its production. Twenty years later 
                finds the Millen Company still the exclusive manufacturer of this 
                component group.<br>
                <br>
                One of the best known items in current manufacture is the Millen 
                Grid Dip Meter. This precision device combines the excellent mechnical 
                design of the Millen Works with the electronic experience of <i>CQ</i>'s 
                own Bill Sherer, W2AEF, and is found in many labs and shops.<br>
                <br>
                Although many items at the Millen factory are components and assembled 
                units for private industry, laboratory work, and government; the 
                major emphasis is still designed in the communications field.<br>
                <br>
                Among the may parts found in the current catalog are a complete 
                line of variable capacitors for both transmitting and receiving, 
                coils of many shapes and values, sockets and terminals, oscilloscopes 
                and their accessories, and many types of special hardware. Of 
                special interest to the radio amateur is the transmitting equipment, 
                antenna matching devices, and the famous dipper. The Millen dials 
                and couplings have also found popularity among hams.<br>
                <br>
                A recent development from the Millen Works is their &quot;No-String&quot; 
                dial and it has already found wide acceptance in the amateur ranks 
                for v.f.o.'s and other tuning applications.<br>
                <br>
                The Millen plant is completely self contained so they can perform 
                all stages of manufacture including the making of tools and dies. 
                This approach allows the company to immediately change or design 
                an item without having to go through the usual time-consuming 
                channels. Better quality control is also assured.<br>
                <br>
                With the company well established Jim now has the time to follow 
                other interests. These include the Vice Chairmanship of a large 
                suburban Boston bank, and boating. Also maintained is a complete 
                electronics library including publications pertaining to radio 
                from the very beginning. Early catalogs, complete collections 
                of <i>Radio, QST,</i>and <i>CQ</i> are kept as well as many books 
                and magazines now out of print. Also in the library is a complete 
                ham station that Jim uses to keep weekly skeds on 75 s.s.b.<br>
                <br>
                Spaning over 50 years in the radio business, the life of James 
                Millen surely ranks as one of the most productive we're likely 
                to see. &quot;Designed for Application&quot; will continue to 
                be a way of life to this vigorous, brilliant and imaginative pioneer 
                of the electronics industry.</font></td>
