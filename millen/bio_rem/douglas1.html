              <P Align=Justify><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for stories, Jim didn't have a lot of contact 
                with hams after the 1930's, when the ARRL headquarters personnel 
                changed. In the early 30's, at least, maybe longer, QST was practically 
                edited from his home, a real bachelor's pad (though I believe 
                his mother lived there too). It was a large farm, no farming was 
                done but there was space for tennis courts, swimming pool, hamshack 
                with sleeping quarters, quite a spread. The ARRL gang would arrive 
                and spend a week playing around while knocking that issue of QST 
                into shape and sending it to the printer (which was not far away).<Br>
                <Br>
                One amazing sight was the hamshack, a separate building near the 
                house, which was basically just as it had been left in the 1930's: 
                ping pong table in the center of the room, the rack-mounted equipment 
                in one corner, the spare final tubes still sitting on the floor 
                where Percy Spencer had left them in 1940 after rebuilding them 
                at the Raytheon lab. When Jim built a hamshack in the house, he 
                simply left the old building as it was; turned the key in the 
                lock and rarely went back in. It was too bad the entire building 
                couldn't have been moved to a museum site and preserved intact, 
                but the access road was much too narrow and overgrown with trees 
                to allow it. The AWA did move most of the equipment out, when 
                Jim was still alive.<Br>
