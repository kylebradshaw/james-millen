              <p align=left><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don 
                is a founding member of The James Millen Society and has been 
                interested in Millen equipment since the early 1990's. Originally 
                the society webpage was part of Don's personal website and was 
                simply called &quot;The Millen Page&quot;.</font>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pictured above shows Don's personal Millen setup. 
                In the rack assembly from top to bottom we start with a 90903 
                scope used as a transmitter modulation monitor. Immediately below 
                is the 90801 transmitter proceeding to the 90831 modulator. The 
                lower half of the rack contains two DC power supplies. The upper 
                supply is for regulated low voltage plate requirements and is 
                set for +250 VDC. This supply also provides all the negative bias 
                voltages required by the transmitter/modulator combination. Although 
                at first glance it appears to be a Millen power supply, it is 
                not! This supply started life as a Lambda commercial 200-325VDC 
                100mA regulated vacuum tube unit. The logo plate on the front 
                was created on transparent sticker material using a laser printer. 
                The sticker was applied to a bare piece of aluminum plate which 
                provides the same appearance of the reverse printed logo plates 
                used by Millen. This supply originally provided a high current 
                AC filament voltage. However that transformer output was reverse 
                feed into another filament transformer, rectified and regulated 
                to provide all the necessary negative bias voltages. In addition, 
                a high voltage sensing circuit was added that disables the 250VDC 
                output until the main transmitter/modulator high voltage (600VDC) 
                becomes active. The lower unit in the rack is a Millen 90281 High 
                Voltage power supply. It provides the aforementioned 600VDC. In 
                the current configuration the plate switch on the 281 supply is 
                all that is required to switch the setup between transmit and 
                receive. Including receiver muting and remote activation of the 
                transmitter VFO. &quot;True vintage push-to-talk or is that switch-to-talk.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Directly to the right of the transmitter rack 
                is a National HRO-5TA1 receiver. Although technically not a Millen-era 
                receiver, as it was manufactured in the 1946/47 time frame or 
                nearly seven years after Millen left National, it retains the 
                look and basic circuit architecture of the earlier HRO's. The 
                5TA1 version is the last of the black HRO receivers and was soon 
                afterward replaced by the less famous HRO-7 which still used the 
                same basic design but began using miniature tubes. This HRO-5TA1 
                is in almost perfect original condition, including tube ID stamping 
                on the gray painted chassis. The only non-original items are being 
                some of his coil units are from earlier series HRO's.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Directly on top the receiver is a Millen 90711 
                VFO. Probably one of the best VFO's ever manufactured! Accurate, 
                stable and it can not be damaged even with a direct short circuit 
                of it output. Since the VFO's output is designed to drive low 
                impedances many users have connected it up directly to an antenna 
                and made contacts. Above the VFO is the matching speaker for the 
                HRO receiver. Not shown in the picture, but placed directly on 
                top of the speaker, is a Millen 92101 antenna preamplifier which 
                is used for 10 meter operations. The preamplifier is mentioned 
                as it was the first Millen piece Don aquired.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don has many other items in his Millen collection, 
                many pictured elsewhere on this site, including his rare and much 
                sought after DFP-201 prototype receiver. For further personal 
                information about Don you can check out his webpage.</font><br>
