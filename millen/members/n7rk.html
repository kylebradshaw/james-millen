 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dave at his
station during the 1995 Straight Key Night (SKN).&nbsp; The HRO-5TA1 he
is using belonged to his elmer W6BAM who became a silent key a few
years ago at age 98. W6BAM was first licensed in 1926 and had already
been playing with radio for almost 40 years when I first met him in
1963. He bought the HRO-5TAI upon returning from WWII and that was his
only receiver up into the early 1990's. <br>

            <p align="left"><font
 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">To the left of
the HRO is a National RAO-7 and on top of that receiver is a
Hallicrafters SX-28. The other radios are a 1936 RCA ACR-175 and a
Meissner Signal Drifter (Shifter) which was what Dave was transmitting
on during SKN. He has several 1930's RCA receivers also. They are neat
radios and not seen often.&nbsp; Behind him you can see a couple of
Howard's, an RME84 and a Swan 500CX. <br>
