                1 - This shows the completed James Millen 500w transmitter in 
                my shack connected up with a 1946 vintage HRO-5RA1. The 90700 
                Vari-arm VFO is setting on top of the HRO-5 speaker. In the photo, 
                you can see the two meters and the green and red lights on the 
                bottom panel of the transmitter; that is the front panel of the 
                power supply for the tabletop portion of the transmitter. The 
                Millen modules, from top to bottom are the 90881-500w RF deck 
                with 812A tubes running class C. The 90905 5&quot; scope to monitor 
                the RF envelop or trapezoid pattern. The 90800-50w exciter with 
                6L6 and 807 and the 90831-speech amp with 6146's in its output 
                driving the grids of the 811A's in class B in the power modulator.</font>

                2 - The high voltage power supply and the power modulator. View 
                schematics of the power supply and modulator <a href="k0eoo-schematics.htm">here</a>! 
                The choke to the right is in series with the HV to the RF deck. 
                The modulation iron is in the back at the left on the other side 
                of the 811A tubes. The mod iron is capacitively coupled across 
                the choke to take the DC off the mod iron secondary; a trick used 
                in many broadcast transmitters. You can see the interconnect cables 
                at the right of the chassis and the two chokes and the HV transformer 
                on the right side of the chassis. The three relays near the center 
                are for Tune/operate, CW/Phone and Plate ON/OFF control.</font><br>

                3 - The bottom side of the HV supply and power modulator. I chose 
                to connect two smaller chassis vs. one larger chassis due to the 
                weight of all the transformers. The trick worked pretty well but 
                I think a steel chassis would have been even sturdier. The power 
                supply filters are on the right and the coupling cap for the modulation 
                is at the top with one of the CW/Phone relays at top left. The 
                small circuit board between the relay and the capacitor is the 
                negative cycle loading circuit. In the lower right of the chassis 
                is the plate relay and at the top right is the filament transformer 
                for the 811A's or the TZ-40's. At this time, I'm using 811A's 
                because with 1450 volts the zero signal plate current is about 
                60ma. The zero signal plate current with the TZ-40's is higher 
                so I would need to add about -9 volts of bias to run those tubes 
                correctly. </font><br>

                To the left of the 811A's is the mod iron and to the right of 
                the tubes is the 25H modulation choke. The plate transformer is 
                center back, the swinging choke is back left, and the smoothing 
                choke is back right.</font><br>

                supplies for the exciter, speech amp, VFO, and AC power for the 
                RF decks filament supply. The bias supplies are located on this 
                chassis. </font><br>

                6 - Notice the multi-pin plugs; each one is for a different Millen 
                module. This way I can easily remove one of the modules for repair. 
                The two-120v outlets in the foreground are switched from the filament 
                ON/OFF switch. One is for the 90905 scope and the other has an 
                isolation transformer for the 90700 VFO. The 90700 VFO is an AC/DC 
                design that doesn't like being connected to a circuit with a ground 
                fault detector. </font><br>

                the tabletop transmitter. This supply includes the 500v for the 
                exciter and speech amp. The 240v for the speech amp and the three 
                -45v bias supplies for the RF deck, speech amp and the exciter. 
                The filament supply for the speech amp and exciter is on this 
                chassis as is all of the switching circuits for the entire transmitter; 
                plate switch, filament switch, tune/operate switch, exciter grid 
                current meter and modulation cathode current meter. The CW/Phone 
                switch is located on the 90831-speech amp and controls two relays 
                on the HV supply to switch the transmitter from Phone to CW. Look 
                at the schematics for details.</font> <br>
